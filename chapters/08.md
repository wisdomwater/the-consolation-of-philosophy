## **Day 8 — When You Learn What Cannot Be Taken**

### **The Fragility of What We Call Happiness**

“If something can be lost,” she said,
“it cannot be the highest good.”

Anything that must be defended,
guarded,
or feared
is already fragile.

And if its loss would not wound you,
then it was never very precious.

True happiness
cannot depend on what death can steal.

For even death
cannot touch what is real.

### **The House That Lasts**

If you want a home
that can survive the storm,
do not build it on shifting sand.

Do not build it on status.
Do not build it on wealth.
Do not build it on applause.

Build it on what is steady.
On what remains
when the winds rise.

Then,
when the seas rage
and the world shakes,
you will still stand.

### **The Question of Value**

“What is it that makes something precious?” she asked.

Gold?
It shines only when it is given away.

Jewels?
Their beauty belongs to them, not to you.

Land?
Its beauty does not come from your ownership.

Clothing?
It adorns the fabric, not the soul.

Servants?
Their goodness is their own,
not yours to possess.

Why do you cling
to what was never truly you?

### **The Quiet Insult We Give Ourselves**

“You were made to carry something greater,” she said.

“You were made with mind and meaning,
with the breath of the divine within you.”

And yet you seek your worth
in objects,
in comforts,
in decoration.

You lower yourself
below what you were meant to be.

A human being
is more than a collection of things.

### **The Inward Turn**

If you want a good
that cannot be stolen,
look where no thief can reach.

Not in what you own.
Not in what you display.

But in what you are.

There,
and only there,
does true wealth live.

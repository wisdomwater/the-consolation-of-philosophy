## Day 8 — The Place Where Happiness Lives

### **The Anchors That Still Hold**

“Dry your tears,” she said quietly.
“The storm has not torn away everything.”

“You still have anchors,” she reminded me —
“confidence for today,
hope for tomorrow.”

“As long as they hold,” I replied,
“we will reach the shore,
even if the voyage is hard.”

“But my glory,” I said softly,
“has slipped from me.”

“We are not finished yet,” she answered.
“But you must stop measuring happiness
by what is missing.”

### **The Uneasy Nature of Every Lot**

“Look,” she said,
“no one’s life is without its wound.”

“One has wealth but no dignity.
One has honor but no ease.
One has marriage but no children.
One has children but no peace.”

“There is always something,” she said,
“that troubles the fortunate.”

“And the more accustomed one is to ease,
the more fragile their joy becomes.”

### **The Hidden Blessing**

“How many,” she asked,
“would call themselves blessed
with even what you still possess?”

“This place you call exile
is home to many.”

“There is nothing miserable,” she said,
“unless you decide it is.”

“He who bears his lot calmly
finds it already softened.”

### **The Pole of True Happiness**

“Where do you seek happiness?” she asked.
“Outside yourself?”

“Tell me —
is there anything you prize more than your own being?”

“If you possess yourself,” she said,
“you possess what Fortune can never take.”

“That which can be stolen
is not the highest good.”

“And what is truly good
cannot be lost.”

### **The Fear That Poisons Joy**

“If your happiness depends on chance,” she said,
“then either you do not know it may vanish —
and live in ignorance —
or you do know —
and live in fear.”

“Neither ignorance nor fear
can be called happiness.”

“And if you lose something without sorrow,
then it was never very precious at all.”

### **The Rock Beneath the Storm**

“Do not build on shifting sand,” she said.
“Do not build on windy heights.”

“Set your house on what does not move.”

“Then let the storms rage,
and the sea roar —
you will remain in peace.”

### **The True Worth of Things**

“Now let us look,” she said,
“at what people call valuable.”

“What is gold worth,” she asked,
“until it is given away?”

“Money shines only when it leaves the hand.”

“And stones — do you admire them?
Their beauty is their own, not yours.”

“They are lower than you,” she said gently.
“Why bow to what has no soul?”

---

### **The Quiet Question**

“And yet,” she asked,
“does not beauty still move you?”

“The sky.
The sea.
The stars.”

I nodded.

“Yes,” I said.
“They do.”

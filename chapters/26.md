## Day 26 — Held Within a Larger Order

### The Still Center

“As what is becoming is to what truly is,” she said,
“as time is to eternity,
as the wide circle is to its quiet center,
so Fate is to Providence.”

“All things turn,” she whispered,
“but God does not.”

“The stars, the seasons, the rise and fall of life — all are carried along by the flowing course of Fate.”
“But the source from which that flow arises is the unmoving mind of God.”

### The Chain That Cannot Break

“This chain of causes binds even human lives,” she said.
“Not as a prison, but as an order that keeps the world from dissolving into chaos.”

“Because it flows from an unchanging Good,” she continued,
“it cannot swerve toward evil.”

“Nothing happens for the sake of wickedness,” she said.
“Even error seeks the good, though it loses its way.”

“What looks like disorder to you,” she added gently,
“is harmony seen too near.”

### The Limits of Human Judgment

“You call it unjust,” she said,
“that good people sometimes suffer while the wicked prosper.”

“But tell me,” she asked,
“do you truly know the hearts of those you judge?”

“Even physicians are not puzzled,” she said,
“when bitter medicine heals one body and harms another.”

“And the soul,” she whispered,
“has its own illnesses and its own cures.”

### The Physician of Souls

“Virtue is the soul’s health,” she said.
“Vice is its disease.”

“And who but God knows which remedy fits which heart?”

“From the high watch-tower of Providence,” she said,
“He sees what each soul needs —
not what it desires,
but what will heal.”

“So He gives sweetness to some,” she said,
“and sharp draughts to others.”

### Why Suffering and Success Are Given

“One soul must be spared adversity,” she said,
“lest it fall into despair.”

“Another must be tested,”
“lest comfort make it forget what it loves.”

“Some are lifted to power,” she said,
“so that injustice may be pruned.”

“Some are pressed by hardship,”
“so that patience may be born.”

“All are being shaped,” she whispered,
“though few understand how.”

---

### When Evil Is Turned

“Even the wicked,” she said,
“are woven into this goodness.”

“For one evil person often drives another toward virtue.”

“Hatred of injustice,” she said,
“has led many back to goodness.”

“To God alone,” she whispered,
“can evil be made to serve good.”

“Nothing escapes the pattern,” she said,
“not even what strays.”

---

### A Trust Beyond Knowing

“I cannot,” she said,
“speak of these things as a god.”

“Nor should a human mind try to grasp all the ways of heaven.”

“But this much is enough,” she said softly:
“God orders all things for good.”

“If you could see with His eyes,” she added,
“you would call nothing evil.”

### The Gentle Pause

“I see you are weary,” she said,
“and your heart is heavy with all this turning.”

“Drink now from song,” she smiled,
“and let it restore you.”

“For the soul, too,
must sometimes rest
before it can keep walking.

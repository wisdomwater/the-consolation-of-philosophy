## Day 11 — The Gift Hidden in Loss

### **The Second Death**

“Death does not bow to fame,” she said.
“High or low, it takes all alike.”

“What remains of the mighty?”
“Only a name carved in stone.”

“Fabricius. Brutus. Cato —
their letters linger,
but they themselves are gone.”

“And when even the name fades,” she added,
“there is a second death.”

Silence felt heavier than stone.

### **The Paradox of Fortune**

“Do not think,” she said gently,
“that I am at war with Fortune.”

“There are times when she does us good.”

“Good fortune lies.
Ill fortune tells the truth.”

“The one enchains us
with pleasing illusions.
The other frees us
by tearing them away.”

“Pain sobers.
Loss awakens.”

### **The Turning of the Heart**

“Those who suffer,” she said,
“learn to watch their steps.”

“They become prepared,
awake,
no longer drunk on ease.”

“Soft fortune leads us astray.
Hard fortune brings us home.”

### **The Unveiling**

“And have you noticed,” she asked,
“what this loss has shown you?”

“Fortune has separated
your true friends
from her own.”

“When she left,
she took her friends with her.”

“She left you yours.”

“What treasure,” she whispered,
“could be greater?”

### **The Wealth That Remains**

“Why mourn what is gone,” she said,
“when what remains
is richer?”

“Friends who stay
when Fortune leaves
are the truest riches of all.”

I felt a warmth rise
where bitterness had lived.

### **The Bond That Holds the World**

Then she sang:

“All things are held by Love —
the stars,
the sea,
the turning skies.”

“Without it,
all would fall into war.”

“Love binds earth to heaven,
husband to wife,
friend to friend.”

“If human hearts were ruled
by this same Love,” she said,
“how peaceful they would be.”

And in that quiet,
I began to believe her.

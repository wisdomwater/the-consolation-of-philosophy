## Day 13 — The Longing That Will Not Be Caged

### **The Wild Return**

“They may be trained,” she said softly, “they may learn the touch of the hand and the sound of the voice—but once blood is tasted, the old will wakes again.”
And I felt the truth of it in my own chest, how something ancient inside us remembers itself.

“Their bonds fall away,” she continued, “and the tamer is the first to suffer.”
Not because the beasts are cruel, but because they are no longer pretending to be something they are not.

So it is with us.
When we have been made to forget who we are, a single taste of freedom can undo a thousand habits of obedience.

What was trained to kneel begins again to stand.
What was taught to serve begins again to burn.

### **The Bird in the Cage**

“And the bird,” she said, “the one who sang in the high branches—can you make it happy with honey and careful hands?”

I saw it in my mind:
the small bright body, the careful feeding, the shining cage.

“He will not eat,” she whispered, “if he can see the woods.
His sorrow is not hunger—it is exile.”

All the kindness in the world cannot replace the sky.
All the comforts of captivity cannot heal the ache of being away from one’s own song.

And so it is with the soul:
even when well-fed, it grieves if it cannot return to what it was made for.

### **The Shape of Return**

“Everything bends back,” she said. “The branch pulled down springs upward again.
The sun sinks, yet rises.
What falls is always seeking its way home.”

There is in every being a curve, a hidden arc,
a remembering that pulls it back toward its source.

“No thing can remain itself,” she said,
“unless it joins its end to its beginning.”

I felt it then—
this quiet circular yearning in me,
as if my own life were a path trying to find its way back to its first light.

### **The Dim Memory of Happiness**

“You too,” she said gently, “dream of your first state.
Even when you cannot see it clearly, you are still moving toward it.”

Happiness is not something we invent.
It is something we half-remember.

Even our mistakes are misdirected prayers.
We reach for what shines because we once lived in brightness.

And though our thoughts are dim,
they are still guided by a hidden true north,
drawing us back to what we are.

### **The Question of Wealth**

“Tell me,” she said, turning toward me,
“when you were rich, were you ever without care?”

I had to be honest.
“No. There was always something missing—or something present that I wished gone.”

“So even then,” she said,
“you lacked what you desired.”

And when one lacks,
can one ever be at peace?

I felt the quiet ache of it:
having much, and yet never enough.

### **What Riches Cannot Give**

“Money,” she said, “cannot keep itself.
It can be taken.
It must be guarded.
It makes you need others.”

What was supposed to make me sufficient
had made me dependent.

“And even when it fills hunger,” she said,
“hunger still remains.
Even when it warms the body,
the cold still returns.”

Nature needs little.
Greed needs forever.

And so wealth consoles,
but it never heals.

---

### **The Faithless Companion**

“Even the one who heaps up gold,” she said,
“is never free from gnawing care.”

His fields are full.
His house is heavy with treasure.
Yet anxiety sits beside him at every meal.

And when he dies,
what he loved most does not follow him.

It leaves him—
as it always has—
faithlessly.

### **The False Light of Honors**

“But surely,” I said, “honor makes one worthy?”

She looked at me with a sad smile.
“Do offices create virtue?
Or do they simply make vice more visible?”

We have all seen it—
the unworthy lifted high,
their smallness broadcast to the world.

“Wisdom,” she said, “carries its own dignity.
It needs no throne.”

But titles cannot make the hollow full.
They only show the crowd what was already there.

And so high places do not ennoble.
They only expose.

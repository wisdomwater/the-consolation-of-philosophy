## **Day 13 — When Power Is Unmasked**

### **The Thinness of Honor**

“Look carefully,” she said,
“at what you call honor.”

A title means one thing in Rome
and nothing among strangers.

What people admire today
they forget tomorrow.

If honor were real in itself,
it would be honored everywhere.

But it is only a shadow
cast by opinion.

And shadows disappear
when the light shifts.

### **The Illusion of Thrones**

“Do you think kings are safe?”

A crown cannot protect its wearer
from fear.

A kingdom cannot guard its king
from worry.

The more power someone seems to hold,
the more they are held
by what they fear to lose.

A ruler who must be guarded
by others
is not truly powerful.

### **The Trap of Favor**

Even those closest to power
are not safe.

Friends of kings fall
when kings fall —
and often even when they don’t.

If your safety depends on another’s favor,
it is not safety at all.

Fortune makes friends
the way wind shapes clouds.

They change.

### **The Song of True Power**

True power is not found
in what you command.

It is found
in what you do not have to obey.

If your fears rule you,
you are not free.

If your cravings lead you,
you are not strong.

The one who governs their own heart
is greater
than any emperor.

### **The Emptiness of Fame and Birth**

Fame is loud
and hollow.

It rises on rumor
and dies on silence.

And noble birth?
It is praise for the dead.

Your ancestors’ virtues
are not yours
unless you live them.

What honors you
is not where you come from,
but who you become.

### **The Final Reminder**

All humans come from one source.
All carry the same divine breath.

So stop measuring yourself
by shadows —
titles, power, applause, bloodlines.

None of these
tell the truth about you.

Only the life you live does.

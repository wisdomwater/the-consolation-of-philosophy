## **Day 15 — When the One Good Is Named**

### **The Discovery**

“Then we agree,” she said.

Satisfaction.
Power.
Honor.
Glory.
Happiness.

They are not five things.

They are one.

Human beings divide what cannot be divided,
and then chase the pieces —
and wonder why they never feel whole.

You tried to grasp one part at a time:
wealth without peace,
power without joy,
honor without rest.

And so you lost even what you reached for.

The good cannot be taken in pieces.
It must be taken whole.

### **Where It Cannot Be Found**

“No mortal thing,” she said,
“can give you this.”

Nothing that fades.
Nothing that dies.
Nothing that can be stolen.

These give only reflections —
hints —
broken shadows.

They point to something real,
but they are not it.

### **Where It Must Be**

“Then where is it?” I asked.

“Not in things,” she said.
“But in what gives things their being.”

The highest good
must be as unchanging as happiness itself.

And what is unchanging
can only be found
in God.

### **The Prayer**

So she prayed.

Not to escape the world,
but to see through it.

Not to destroy the body,
but to be freed from illusion.

Not for more possessions,
but for clearer sight.

“Let us return,” she said,
“to the source of all good.
Let us rise,
as fire rises,
toward what we were made for.”

### **The Quiet Union**

True happiness
is not something God gives.

It is God.

To be whole
is to be aligned
with the deepest reality.

To be at peace
is to rest
in the One
who does not change.

You have not been chasing many things.

You have been chasing One
in many disguises.

And now
you are finally being shown
His face.

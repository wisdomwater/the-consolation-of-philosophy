## Day 15 — The False Sweetness and the One Good

### **The Beginning We Forget**

“If God is your beginning,” she said,
“who among you is truly base—
except the one who turns away from that source?”

Nothing is born vile.
Only forgetting makes us small.

To abandon what we came from
is the deepest kind of poverty.

And every vice is, at its root,
a wandering from our own light.

---

### **The Sting Beneath Pleasure**

“What shall I say of bodily pleasures?” she asked softly.
“Their desire is anxious, and their fulfilment bitter.”

Even when they give sweetness,
they leave a shadow behind.

The body remembers every indulgence
with a quieter sorrow.

“Like a bee,” she said,
“pleasure brings honey—
and then leaves a sting in the heart.”

---

### **The Weight of Loving What Can Wound**

“Some find joy in wife and children,” she said,
“yet others find torment there.”

Not because love is false,
but because what we love
can wound us.

To love what can be lost
is to consent to grief.

And so even our brightest attachments
carry hidden thorns.

---

### **The Roads That Betray**

“These are not paths to happiness,” she said.
“They only pretend to be.”

To seek wealth, you must steal or beg.
To seek honor, you must kneel.
To seek power, you must fear.
To seek pleasure, you must serve what is brittle.

Each promise asks for your dignity as its price.

And when you have paid,
you discover
you bought nothing.

---

### **The Frailty of the Body**

“Would you compete with beasts?” she asked gently.
“Outrun the tiger? Outgrow the elephant?”

The body you worship
can be undone by a fever.

And the beauty you admire
is only what weak eyes see.

“Look within,” she said,
“and the shining surface gives way
to something far less fair.”

---

### **The Eyes That Cannot See**

“It is not your nature,” she said,
“that makes you seem beautiful—
it is the blindness of those who look.”

We mistake what glitters
for what is good.

And so we cling to flowers of spring,
not knowing how quickly they fall.

---

### **The Hidden Good**

“Men know where pearls lie,” she said.
“They know where scarlet dyes are drawn.”

They search the seas,
they map the depths,
they measure the stars—

yet they do not know
where their own good is hidden.

It has soared beyond the heavens,
and still they look for it in dust.

---

### **The One That Was Divided**

“You now see,” she said,
“what false happiness is.”

“But what is the true?” I asked.

“It is simple,” she replied,
“and you have torn it apart.”

What cannot be divided
you have scattered.

What was whole
you tried to possess in pieces.

---

### **The Four That Are One**

“Tell me,” she said,
“can something that lacks nothing be powerless?”

“No.”

“And what is powerful yet lacking?”
“Nothing.”

“So power and satisfaction are one.
And what is worthy of veneration
must be added to them.
And what is not contemptible
must have glory.”

I felt the pieces drawing together.

One thing—
full, strong, honored, radiant.

---

### **The Name of Happiness**

“That which lacks nothing,” she said,
“that is powerful in itself,
that is worthy of reverence and full of glory—

that alone
is truly happy.”

And for the first time,
I sensed the shape of it—
not scattered,
not anxious,
but whole.

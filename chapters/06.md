## **Day 6 — When Fortune Is Finally Seen for What It Is**

### **The Wheel**

“You chose her,” she said quietly.
“You placed yourself under her rule.”

“If you sail by the wind,
you go where the wind carries you.
If you plant seeds,
you accept both harvest and drought.”

“You cannot ask Fortune to be steady,”
she said.
“If she ever stopped turning,
she would no longer be Fortune.”

Her wheel rises and falls.
Kings are lifted.
Kings are crushed.
Tears are ignored.
Cries go unheard.

This is her game.

Not cruelty.
Not kindness.
But motion.

### **Fortune Speaks**

“If I were to defend myself,”
she might say,
“I have done you no wrong.

I did not promise permanence.
I gave you what was mine to give.
Now I take it back.

If it had truly belonged to you,
you would not have lost it.”

“I gave you wealth, honour, applause.
They were never yours.
They were mine —
and I let you borrow them.”

“I do not belong to anyone.
I turn.
That is what I am.”

### **The Hunger That Never Ends**

Even when abundance flows,
the human heart still aches.

More.
More.
More.

Greed grows faster
than any gift.

The one who always wants more
is never rich.

### **The Gentle Truth**

“You are right,” she said,
“these words sound beautiful,
but sorrow runs deeper.”

So let us not pretend
you do not hurt.

But also,
do not pretend
you had nothing.

Remember the love that held you
when you were young.

Remember the honour that found you.

Remember the day your children
walked into the world
with dignity and promise.

These were real.

Even if they passed.

### **A Quiet Turning**

Fortune gives.
Fortune takes.

But meaning
is not measured
by what remains in your hands.

It is measured
by what remains
in your heart.

## Day 6 — The Unmasking of Fortune

### **The Hidden Longing**

She let silence settle between us,
and in that quiet my thoughts slowly stilled.
Then she spoke, as though reading a truth I had not yet dared to name.

“You are not grieving what you are,” she said.
“You are grieving what you were.”

“It is the memory of former brightness
that now burns in you like a wound.
You do not miss Fortune —
you miss the way she once made you feel.”

“And because one face of her has turned away,
your peace has been overturned.”

### **The Two Faces**

“Do you not remember,” she asked softly,
“how even when she smiled you did not trust her?”

“You knew her flattery was hollow.
You warned others.
You warned yourself.”

“Now she has simply shown you her other face.”

“If you loved her gifts, then use them when they come.
If you hate her treachery, then refuse her power over you.”

“But do not be surprised,” she said,
“that she is what she has always been.”

### **The Nature of Fleeting Good**

“Can that be called happiness,” she asked,
“which must leave you?”

“Can something be good
that turns into sorrow by its very absence?”

“Prudence does not look only at what is now,
but at what will follow.”

“And when you give yourself to Fortune,” she said,
“you accept not just her smiles,
but her turning.”

“If you wish her wheel to stop for you alone,
you are asking her to stop being what she is.”

### **The Yoke We Choose**

“If you set your sails,” she said,
“you cannot command the wind.”

“If you sow seed,
you must take both harvest and drought.”

“You chose her realm.
Now you must walk within its laws.”

“To demand that she remain
is to demand that Fortune not be Fortune.”

### **The Wheel**

Her voice softened, but her words cut clean.

“She lifts and she casts down.
She crowns and she crushes.
She listens neither to tears nor to prayers.”

“This is her game.
This is her boast.”

“Today a king.
Tomorrow a captive.”

“And she calls that her justice.”

### **Fortune Speaks**

“Listen,” she said,
“and hear how Fortune herself would answer you.”

“‘What have I taken that was ever yours?’
she would say.

“‘I gave you all you had.
I may take it back.’

“‘You were born naked into my arms,
and I clothed you.
Now I loosen my grip.’”

“‘Wealth and honor are my servants.
They come when I come.
They go when I go.’”

### **The Law of Change**

“‘The sun gives day and takes it away,’
she would say.
“‘The year blooms and then withers.’”

“‘Why should I alone be forced
to pretend constancy?’”

“‘Come, rise if you wish,’
she laughs,
“‘but do not complain when the wheel turns.’”

And as she spoke these words,
I felt something begin to loosen —
as though the spell of former brightness
were finally breaking.

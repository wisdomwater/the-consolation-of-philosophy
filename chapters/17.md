## **Day 17 — When Unity Is Seen to Be the Good**

### **The Center of All Desire**

“All things are sought for the sake of the Good,” she said.

People chase wealth.
They chase power.
They chase pleasure.

But these are not the goal.

They are broken mirrors
of one thing:

Happiness —
the Good itself.

And since God and happiness are one,
every true desire
is secretly a longing for God.

### **The Song of the True Light**

Come, she sang,
all you who are bound by cravings and fear.

Here is rest.
Here is a harbor
no storm can touch.

Gold blinds.
Jewels darken.

But the true light
does not glitter —
it clarifies.

### **Why Unity Is the Key**

“Good things become good,” she said,
“when they become one.”

Fragmented desires
cannot satisfy.

But when satisfaction, power, honor, joy, and peace
are gathered into one reality,
they become the true Good.

Unity is not just harmony —
it is being itself.

### **Why Everything Tries to Stay Alive**

Every being
tries to remain itself.

Bodies stay whole.
Plants grow roots where they belong.
Fire rises.
Stones fall.
Water returns to itself.

Even what has no thought
moves toward what preserves it.

Nothing wants to be broken.
Nothing wants to be undone.

To exist
is to seek unity.

And to seek unity
is to seek the Good.

### **The Quiet Revelation**

Everything that lives
is leaning toward wholeness.

Everything that endures
is clinging to unity.

Everything that loves life
is reaching for God —
even when it does not know His name.

You have never desired anything
except this:

To be whole.
To be real.
To be at peace.

And that
is the Good.

## Day 17 — The Place Where Happiness Lives

### **From the Perfect to the Broken**

“Nature does not begin with what is weak,” she said.
“It begins with what is whole,
and only later do the lesser forms appear.”

So if there is a happiness
that flickers and fails,
there must be a happiness
that does not.

The imperfect points back to the perfect,
as shadows point to light.

And I knew, quietly,
that what we taste here in fragments
must exist somewhere in fullness.

### **The Fount of All Good**

“Everyone agrees,” she said,
“that God is good—
for nothing can be thought better.”

And if nothing is better,
then all good must flow from Him.

“If the perfect good were not in God,” she said,
“it would have to come from something greater.
And nothing is greater.”

So the highest good
must be where the highest being is.

And happiness,
being the highest good,
must dwell there too.

### **Not Something God Has, but What God Is**

“Do not think,” she said gently,
“that God received goodness,
or that happiness sits in Him like a jewel in a crown.”

If it came from outside Him,
something else would be greater than He is.

And if goodness were merely attached to Him,
then He would not be goodness itself.

“What differs from the good,” she said,
“cannot be the good.”

So God is not a holder of happiness.
He is happiness.

### **The Name of God**

“You have agreed,” she said,
“that the highest good is happiness.”

“Yes.”

“Then you must also agree
that God is absolute happiness.”

I felt it settle in me,
not as a thought
but as a truth.

Two highest goods cannot exist.
They would limit each other.

And since God is the highest,
and happiness is the highest,
they are one.

### **The Daring Consequence**

She smiled.
“Let me add something more.”

“If happiness is God,
and humans become happy by sharing in happiness,
then when they become happy,
they share in God.”

As one becomes just by justice,
and wise by wisdom,
so one becomes divine
by participating in divinity.

“Every happy soul,” she said softly,
“is, in that measure, divine.”

God is divine by nature.
We become divine by nearness.

### **One Good, Not Many**

“Happiness seems to contain many things,” she said—
satisfaction, power, honor, joy.

“But are these pieces?
Or are they all one?”

They could not be parts,
for they do not differ.

They are the same light
named many ways.

And so happiness
is not a body with limbs,
but a single heart
beating in many rhythms.

### **Why We Want What We Want**

“Why do we desire all these things?” she asked.

“Because they seem good.”

The good is what pulls us.
It is the hinge of every longing.

We seek power, honor, pleasure, rest—
not for their own sake,
but because each whispers,
“I will give you the good.”

Like riding for the sake of health,
we chase the means
hoping for the end.

But the end is always the same:

We want the good
that makes us whole.

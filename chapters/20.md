## **Day 20 — Why the Good Are Strong and the Wicked Are Weak**

### **Two Ways of Walking**

If one person walks on their feet
and another crawls on their hands,
which is more capable?

The one using their natural power.

So it is with the soul.

The good seek happiness
through virtue —
the way they were made.

The wicked seek the same happiness
through craving, force, and deceit —
a way that was never meant to work.

Both want the same end.

But only one walks on their feet.

### **Why Wickedness Is Powerlessness**

The wicked are always striving.

Always grasping.

Always chasing.

And they never arrive.

They aim for the highest good —
happiness —
but abandon the only road that leads to it.

So they fail
at the very thing they most desire.

This is not strength.

It is collapse.

### **The Shocking Truth**

Here is the hardest thing Philosophy says:

Those who abandon goodness
abandon being itself.

Not that they vanish —
but they live below their own nature.

Like a corpse is still “a man”
but no longer truly alive.

Evil is not a different kind of power.

It is a loss of reality.

### **Why the Power to Do Harm Is Not Power**

The highest good can do all things —
except evil.

So if something can only do harm,
it can do less than what is truly powerful.

The ability to destroy
is not strength.

It is absence of strength.

### **Why Tyrants Are the Most Enslaved**

Kings in purple
are often bound by invisible chains:

greed
rage
fear
desire
grief
ambition

They command nations
but cannot command their own hearts.

They look powerful.

They are not.

### **The True Reward**

Goodness carries its reward inside itself.

It does not wait for applause.

It does not fear loss.

It is already crowned
because it is already whole.

Evil carries its punishment
inside itself too.

It is the ache of never becoming
what you were meant to be.

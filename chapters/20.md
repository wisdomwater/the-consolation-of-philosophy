## Day 20 — The Light That Draws All Things Home

### **Strength That Is Gentle**

“So the highest good,” she said,
“guides with strength
and disposes with gentleness.”

And I felt how different that was
from the power I had feared—
a power that crushes.

This power
holds.

It does not force the world.
It steadies it.

### **The Circle of Truth**

“You think I am leading you through a maze,” I said,
“but everything you say
returns to the same place.”

Happiness.
Goodness.
God.
One truth,
spoken many ways.

And she smiled.

“The divine,” she said,
“is not scattered.
It is whole,
like a perfect sphere.”

What we discover here
we do not bring from outside.
We uncover it from within.

### **The Good That Cannot Do Evil**

“God is all-powerful,” she said.

“Yes.”

“Then He can do all things.”

“Yes.”

“But not evil.”

“No.”

“Then evil,” she said quietly,
“is nothing.”

Not a force.
Not a rival.
Only a shadow where the good is refused.

And I felt how strangely freeing that was—
to realize that darkness
has no substance of its own.

### **The Longing for the Fount**

“Happy is the one,” she sang,
“who drinks from the crystal spring of good,
who shakes off the chains of earth.”

There is a place in us
that remembers such water.

And everything in us
aches to return there.

### **The Song of Orpheus**

She told me of Orpheus,
who loved so fiercely
that even hell was moved.

His song made beasts gentle.
It made torment pause.
It opened gates no force could break.

And yet his own desire
undid him.

He looked back.

---

### **The One Law That Cannot Be Broken**

“Who,” she asked,
“can set laws for love?”

Love burns
with its own necessity.

And so, even in the moment of grace,
Orpheus turned.

He saw the darkness.
And in seeing it,
lost the light he carried.

### **The Meaning of the Tale**

“This story is for you,” she said.

You are leading your thoughts upward.
You are being given a way out of shadow.

But if you turn your gaze
back toward what you are leaving—

if desire pulls you downward—

you lose the very thing
that was being given.

To look at the darkness
is to forget the light.

And the forgetting
is the fall.

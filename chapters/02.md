## Day 2 — The Steadying of the Soul

### **The Returning Light**

Just as a storm loosens its grip and the sun breaks through,
so the heaviness around my eyes began to lift.
“What was dim now glimmers,” I thought, “and I can breathe again.”

I turned my gaze toward the one who had wiped my tears.
And suddenly I knew her.
“My nurse,” I whispered inwardly, “the one who raised me in the chambers of wisdom.”

“Why have you come all this way?” I asked her.
“Is it to share my exile, to be wounded by false words as I have been?”

She smiled — not gently, but with a strength that steadies the heart.
“Would I abandon my own child?” she said.
“Would I leave you alone beneath this weight?”

### **The Fellowship of the Tested**

“Do you think this is new?” she asked quietly.
“Wisdom has always been chased by the noise of folly.”

“Socrates drank his poison with me at his side.
Plato walked through storms of slander.
And after them came many who were torn for loving truth too much.”

“They tried to seize me,” she said, touching the torn hem of her robe.
“They pulled at my cloth and mistook the scraps for my whole self.”

“But even when they think they have won me,
they walk away holding nothing but rags.”

Her eyes held neither bitterness nor fear.
Only a long memory of courage.

### **The Fortress Within**

“In this world,” she said, “we are always at sea.
And fools are many.”

“They rush in crowds, guided by no reason,
plundering what is least worth taking.”

“But when they gather against us,” she went on,
“Reason draws us back into our citadel.”

“Let them seize their worthless spoils.
We stand above them, protected by walls they cannot climb.”

I felt something straighten inside me —
as though my spine remembered its own strength.

### **The Unconquered Face**

“There is a kind of person,” she said softly,
“who has made peace with fate.”

“Death no longer frightens them.
Fortune no longer commands them.”

“Storms may rise.
Fire may burst from the mountain.
Lightning may tear down towers.”

“But still they stand.”

“Fear nothing.
Desire nothing.
And tyranny will find no place to grip you.”

### **The Invitation to Speak**

She looked at me now, searching.
“Are these words reaching you,” she asked,
“or are they falling like music on deaf ears?”

“Why do you still weep?”
“Speak,” she urged. “Do not hide the wound.”

“If you want to be healed,” she said gently,
“you must first let me see where it hurts.”

Something in me stirred —
a readiness, fragile but real.

### **The Cry of the Just**

“Does my suffering really need explaining?” I said at last.
“Look around. Does this place not speak for me?”

“Is this the room where you once taught me
the order of the stars and the harmony of all things?”

“Is this the face I wore
when I traced the movements of heaven with your hand beside mine?”

“Are these the rewards of a life shaped by wisdom?”

“You taught me,” I said,
“that a people flourish when those who rule love truth —
or when those who love truth are allowed to rule.”

“I believed you.”

### **The Cost of Integrity**

“I entered public life not for myself,
but for the good of all.”

“I opposed those who devoured the weak.
I turned back the greedy.
I placed my own safety at risk to shield the helpless.”

“I stood against unjust taxes.
I fought famine profiteers.
I pulled honest men from the jaws of courtly wolves.”

“Never did I let power bend me away from justice,” I said.
“My heart broke with those who were wronged.”

“And this,” I whispered,
“is where it has led me.”

Silence settled between us —
not empty, but waiting.

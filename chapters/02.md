## **Day 2 — When You Remember Who Has Been With You**

### **The Recognition**

As the fog in my eyes began to lift,
I finally saw who was sitting beside me.

It was her.

The one who had raised me in the love of truth.
The one who had taught me how to think,
how to wonder,
how to live.

“Why have you come here?” I asked.
“Have you been dragged down too,
like me,
into this place of false accusations and exile?”

She looked at me gently.

“Would I ever leave you?” she said.
“Do you think I would abandon you
just because the world has turned against you?”

“This is not new,” she continued.
“Wisdom has always been hunted by power.
It was so in the time of Socrates.
It was so with those who came after him.
Those who tried to live by truth
have always been treated as threats.”

“You are not the first,” she said,
“and you will not be the last.”

Then she spoke of something deeper.

“There are those who love truth,
and there are those who love control.
When these two meet,
conflict is inevitable.”

“But when the storm comes,” she said,
“reason gathers itself inside.
And those who rage outside,
grabbing at what does not matter,
only reveal how empty their power truly is.”

### **The Song of Inner Freedom**

A person who has made peace with fate
cannot be shaken by threat or reward.

Storms may rage.
Mountains may burn.
Lightning may strike.

But the one who no longer fears death
or craves approval
stands unmoved.

Fear creates chains.
Desire creates chains.

Freedom is born when you stop needing
what others use to control you.

### **The Wound Speaks**

She turned to me.

“Are these words reaching you?” she asked.
“Or are you still too numb to hear?”

“If you want to be healed,” she said softly,
“you must let me see where it hurts.”

So I did.

I told her about the life I had tried to live.

How I stood up to those who abused their power.
How I defended the weak.
How I resisted corruption.
How I refused to let greed and cruelty have the final word.

I told her about the enemies this made.
The accusations.
The betrayals.
The cost.

“I did not seek power for myself,” I said.
“I wanted a world that was fair.
I wanted goodness to matter.”

“And this,” I said, looking around my prison,
“is what it earned me.”

### **A quiet truth**

Sometimes the deepest grief
is not that we failed.

It is that we were faithful —
and it still was not enough
to protect us.

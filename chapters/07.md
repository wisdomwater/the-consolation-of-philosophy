## Day 7 — The Ledger of What Remains

### **The Two Vessels**

She spoke as though finishing Fortune’s own defense.
“At the threshold of heaven,” she said,
“stand two vessels — one of sorrow, one of blessing.”

“You have drawn deeply from the good.
Why should you think the cup will never change?”

“Live, then, as a citizen of this world,
not as one who demands exemption from its laws.”

Her words were quiet, but they struck with weight.

### **The Hunger That Never Rests**

“Even when abundance pours out,” she said,
“human hearts still ache for more.”

“Gold comes.
Honor comes.
Still the hunger grows.”

“Never call that person rich,” she whispered,
“who trembles over what they might yet lack.”

### **The Gentle Confrontation**

“Now speak,” she said to me.
“If Fortune is unjust, tell me how.”

“These words are beautiful,” I replied.
“They soothe the ear.”

“But misery lies deeper than song.
When the sound fades,
the sorrow still remains.”

She nodded.
“Then let us look not only at what you lost,
but at what you were given.”

### **The Days of Fullness**

“Do you remember,” she asked,
“how you were welcomed when you were young?
How noble families drew you into their homes?”

“Your marriage.
Your sons.
Your honors.”

“And that great day,” she said,
“when both your sons walked forth as consuls together —
the city rejoicing,
your voice lifting in praise,
the crowd answering with delight.”

“Has any grief,” she asked,
“erased the beauty of that day?”

### **The Balance of Fortune**

“You took Fortune’s gifts freely,” she said.
“She gave you more than she gave most.”

“Is it just to complain now
because she has once turned her face?”

“If what once made you glad has passed,
so too will what now makes you sorrowful.”

“You are not new to this world.
You knew the stage was change.”

### **The Law of All Things**

“Nothing born here remains,” she said.
“Roses fade.
Stars pale.
Seas rise and fall.”

“And so do human fortunes.”

“Do not trust what cannot stay.”

### **The Pain of Remembering**

“Yes,” I said softly,
“it is the memory that hurts.”

“To have known happiness
is the sharpest sorrow.”

She looked at me with compassion.

“And yet,” she said,
“you still possess what is best.”

“Your father-in-law still lives,
wise and upright.”

“Your wife still loves you,
clinging to life for your sake.”

“Your sons still walk in honor.”

“These are not small things,” she said.
“Not even Fortune can steal them.”

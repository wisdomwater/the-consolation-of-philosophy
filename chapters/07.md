## **Day 7 — When What Hurts Most Is What Once Was**

### **The Hard Truth About Change**

“You have known great happiness,” she said.
“And you have known great loss.”

“But if you count both the good and the sorrow,
you cannot honestly say
that life has only been cruel to you.”

“If you grieve because good things passed,”
remember this:
the painful things will pass too.

Nothing in this world stays.

Not success.
Not failure.
Not even life.

So tell me,” she asked gently,
“did Fortune leave you —
or did you leave her when you were born?”

### **The Song of What Fades**

The morning sun dims the stars.
A spring rose blooms —
and falls.

The calm sea stirs into storm.
Then settles again.

Nothing made in time
is made to last.

So why do you trust
what was never meant to stay?

### **The Wound of Memory**

I answered her honestly.

“You are right.
I was blessed.”

“But that is why this hurts so much.”

The deepest sorrow
is not that we suffer —
it is that we remember
what it felt like
not to.

To have known joy
and lose it
is sharper
than never having known it at all.

### **The Gifts That Remain**

“But look,” she said softly.
“Not everything is gone.”

“Your wife still lives —
a soul full of love and faithfulness.”

“Your children still live —
carrying your spirit forward.”

“Your father-in-law still stands —
a man of wisdom and courage,
grieving for you.”

“These are not small things.
These are treasures
that Fortune cannot touch.”

### **The Turning Point**

“There is no life
without some ache,” she said.

Even the fortunate suffer:
wealth without honor,
family without peace,
success without joy.

No one has it all.

So stop measuring yourself
against what you lack.

Look at what still holds you.

### **The Door Inward**

“You keep looking outside
for what can only be found within.”

If you belong to yourself,
Fortune cannot steal you.

If you live from what is deepest,
no storm can make you poor.

The highest good
is not something that can be taken.

It is something you are.

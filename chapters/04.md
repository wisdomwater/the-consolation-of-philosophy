## Day 4 — The Home We Forgot

### **The Cry for Order**

I had lifted my voice to heaven,
naming the seasons and the stars,
the moon’s pale horn and the evening star’s cool fire.

“You have set all things in their places,” I cried,
“and nothing escapes your law.”

“And yet we — we are cast upon the waves of Fortune,
where guilt walks free and innocence is crushed.”

“Look down,” I begged.
“Do not let the world you made drift without your care.”

### **The Calm Gaze**

She listened without being shaken.
No anger flickered in her face,
no impatience, no sorrow.

“When I first saw your tears,” she said,
“I knew you were suffering.
But now I see how far you have wandered.”

“You are not exiled by others,” she told me gently.
“You have walked away from your own country.”

“There is one true kingdom,” she said,
“ruled not by crowds but by one just King,
who rejoices not in banishment,
but in the fullness of those who dwell with Him.”

“To live under His justice,” she whispered,
“is the truest freedom.”

### **The Heart as Home**

“No one can be cast out of that country,” she said,
“unless they first leave it.”

“It is not these walls that grieve me,” she went on,
“nor the shattered quiet of your library.”

“It is the chamber of your heart.”

“For there is where I dwell —
not in shelves of books,
but in the thoughts that give books their life.”

“You have told your story truly,” she said.
“But you are torn apart by grief, rage, and despair.
And so we must begin gently.”

### **The Wisdom of Seasons**

“Do not seek violets in winter,” she said.
“Do not prune vines in spring and expect wine.”

“Every gift has its hour.
Every work its season.”

“When anything breaks its proper rhythm,
it brings only ruin to itself.”

“So we will move slowly,” she told me.
“First we soften the wound.
Later we will heal it.”

### **The First Question**

“Let me ask you something,” she said.
“Is this world guided by blind chance —
or by reason?”

“By God,” I answered at once.
“I know it.”

“And yet,” she smiled sadly,
“you believe everything is governed —
except your own life.”

“How strange to be so ill
while holding such a healing truth.”

“Tell me,” she said softly,
“how do you think God governs the world?”

I fell silent.
I could not answer.

### **The Forgotten End**

“Do you remember,” she asked,
“what all things are for?”

“I once did,” I whispered,
“but sorrow has dimmed it.”

“And do you remember where all things come from?”

“From God.”

“And can you know the beginning,” she asked,
“and forget the end?”

“Distraction shakes you,” she said,
“but it has not torn you from yourself.”

“Tell me one thing more,” she asked.

“Do you remember that you are a human being?”

## **Day 4 — When Wisdom Begins to Gently Turn You Back Toward Yourself**

### **The Cry for Order**

O Maker of the stars,
You who set the moon in her phases
and the sun in its path,
You who guide the seasons
and give each thing its time—

Look upon us.

The heavens move with harmony,
yet here on earth
the innocent are crushed
and the corrupt sit at ease.

Those who do wrong walk freely.
Those who try to live justly
are buried under shame.

We are not small to You.
We are part of this great work.
Why, then, are we tossed
like debris on Fortune’s waves?

If You hold the sky in order,
hold us too.

### **The Calm Reply**

While I poured out these words,
Wisdom watched me quietly.

Then she spoke,
not sharply,
not impatiently,
but with a steady, clear gaze.

“I knew you were unhappy,” she said.
“But I did not know how far from home
you believed yourself to be.”

“You have not truly been exiled,” she continued.
“You have only wandered away
from what you are.”

“There is a place where no one can be banished —
where one ruler reigns not by fear,
but by care.
To live under that rule
is the highest freedom.”

“You think you have lost your home,” she said.
“But what I see
is that you have turned your eyes away from it.”

“I do not need the walls of your library,”
she said gently.
“I need the place in your heart
where I once lived.”

### **The Diagnosis**

“You have spoken truthfully,” she said,
about your service,
about the injustice,
about the ingratitude,
about the cruelty of fortune.

But you are being torn apart
by too many storms at once —
grief, anger, despair, outrage.

Right now,
you are too tender
for strong medicine.

So we will begin softly.

### **The Song of Right Timing**

A farmer who sows in the wrong season
will starve,
no matter how hard he works.

Violets do not bloom in winter.
Grapes do not ripen in spring.

All things have their time.

God has written a rhythm
into the world.
And when we ignore it,
we suffer.

Not because we are punished —
but because we are out of tune.

### **The First Gentle Questions**

“Let me ask you something,” she said.

“Do you believe the world is ruled by chaos,
or by meaning?”

“No,” I answered.
“I know there is order.
I know God is still there.”

“And yet,” she said,
“you speak as though humanity were abandoned.”

“Do you remember
what everything is for?” she asked.

“I once knew,” I said.
“But grief has dimmed it.”

“And do you remember
where everything comes from?”

“God,” I said.

She looked at me kindly.

“How strange,” she said,
“that you remember the beginning,
but not the end.”

“Distraction can shake a person’s place,” she said,
“but it cannot destroy who they are.”

Then she asked quietly:

“Do you remember
that you are a human being?”

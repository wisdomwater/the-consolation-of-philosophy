## **Day 14 — When the Many Goods Become One**

### **The Hunger That Never Ends**

The pleasures of the body, she said,
are sweet — and then they wound.

They promise delight,
but leave behind regret.

They excite,
but do not satisfy.

They bind the soul
to what fades.

And if pleasure were true happiness,
then animals would be the most blessed of all —
for their whole life is ruled by appetite.

Yet we know
that a human heart wants more.

### **The Cost of False Goods**

Every false good
demands a hidden payment.

Wealth asks you to take from others.
Honor asks you to bow to those who grant it.
Power asks you to fear those beneath you.
Fame asks you to surrender your peace.
Pleasure asks you to become a servant of the body.

None of them deliver
what they promise.

They glitter —
and then they drain.

### **The Great Mistake**

The error, she said,
is not that we desire good things.

The error
is that we tear them apart.

We chase satisfaction,
but forget power.

We chase power,
but forget worth.

We chase worth,
but forget peace.

We chase joy,
but forget wholeness.

But the true good
cannot be divided.

### **The Gathering of the Good**

“What is truly happy?” she asked.

Something that lacks nothing.
Something that depends on nothing.
Something that cannot be diminished.
Something that is worthy of reverence.
Something that is full of power.
Something that is radiant with meaning.

These are not separate things.

They are one.

And where they are united,
there is happiness.

### **The Quiet Revelation**

True happiness
is not a collection of gifts.

It is a state of being.

A fullness
that does not leak.

A peace
that does not break.

A good
that does not need to borrow.

And this —
this is what your soul
has always been seeking.

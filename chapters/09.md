## **Day 9 — When the World’s Treasures Lose Their Shine**

### **The Weight of Possession**

The strange thing about wealth
is that it makes us afraid.

Before we own much,
we fear little.

After we own much,
we fear losing it.

Gold invites thieves.
Status invites rivals.
Comfort invites anxiety.

So the more we gather,
the more we must protect.

And suddenly,
what we thought would make us free
becomes a cage.

### **The Song of Simpler Days**

There was a time, she said,
when people lived simply.

They ate what the land gave.
They drank from the stream.
They slept beneath the trees.

They did not know silk or wine or jewels.
They did not cross oceans for profit.
They did not kill for gain.

They were poor by our standards —
and rich in peace.

Then greed learned to dig into the earth
and pull out what was meant to rest there.

And with treasure
came war.

### **The Illusion of Power**

“What do you mean by power?” she asked.

To command bodies?
To threaten lives?

Even a tiny creature
can end a powerful person.

A bite.
A sickness.
A moment.

No one has power over the soul
unless the soul gives it.

A tyrant can torture a body,
but cannot rule a free mind.

The one who knows this
is stronger than any throne.

### **The Lie of Honor**

Offices and titles
do not make people noble.

Noble people
make offices honorable.

If power were good in itself,
it would not cling so easily
to the cruel.

But when bad people rise,
their wickedness is not healed —
it is only amplified.

### **The Shadow of Fame**

“And what of reputation?” she asked.

The earth is a speck
in a vast universe.

The people who live on it
are a fraction of that speck.

And the number who know your name
is smaller still.

Why give your heart
to something so thin?

### **The Quiet Truth**

Wealth.
Power.
Fame.

None of these make a person good.
None of these make a person safe.
None of these make a person whole.

Only what is rooted inside you
can do that.

## Day 9 — The Poverty of What We Call Wealth

### **The Borrowed Splendor**

“Do any of these things belong to you?” she asked.
“Do you bloom like spring?
Do you ripen like autumn?”

“Why do you wrap yourself in what is not you?”
“Fortune cannot make yours
what nature never gave you.”

“If you eat to satisfy hunger,” she said,
“you need little.
Only excess creates distress.”

### **The Burden of Possession**

“Are you adorned by fine garments?”
“Then praise the cloth, not yourself.”

“Do you rejoice in servants?”
“If they are corrupt, they poison your house.
If they are virtuous, their goodness is not yours.”

“What do you truly own?” she asked.
“Nothing here answers.”

“The more you have,
the more you must guard.”

“And the less you need,
the freer you become.”

---

### **The Forgotten Dignity**

“Is there nothing within you,” she said,
“that is worthy of love?”

“You were made in reason —
akin to God.”

“And yet you seek your worth
among lifeless things.”

“When humans forget themselves,” she said,
“they sink beneath the beasts.”

“To animals, ignorance is natural.
To humans, it is a fall.”

### **The Harm of Riches**

“Nothing is good,” she said,
“that harms its possessor.”

“Gold brings thieves.
Stones bring fear.”

“You fear robbers now,” she added gently,
“but you would fear nothing
if you had nothing to lose.”

“So strange,” she sighed,
“that wealth brings worry
the moment it arrives.”

### **The Simpler Age**

She sang of a time
when acorns were enough,
when water was sweet,
and shade was free.

“When no one bled for gain,
and no one crossed seas for gold.”

“When earth itself was wealth.”

---

### **The Illusion of Power**

“And what of power?” she asked.
“Is it anything more
than danger in a finer robe?”

“When evil men hold office,
cities burn.”

“And even when the good rule,
it is their goodness that shines —
not the seat they occupy.”

“Power does not make virtue.
Virtue makes power.”

---

### **The Unconquered Spirit**

“Over whom do you rule?” she asked.

“Over bodies?
Over fortunes?”

“A free soul remains untouched.”

“No tyrant can command
what reason holds.”

“Even pain,” she said,
“can be turned into defiance.”

“And what kind of power,” she asked,
“cannot even save itself?”

## Day 21 — The Wings That Lift Us Beyond Injustice

### **The Cry of the Heart**

“Herald of true light,” I said,
“how can evil exist in a world ruled by goodness?”

My grief rose up again—
not quiet now,
but aching.

“Wickedness prospers.
The just are crushed.
Crime is crowned,
and innocence pays the cost.”

How could such things be
under a good and all-powerful God?

### **The Promise of a Higher Sight**

She did not dismiss my pain.

“If that were truly so,” she said,
“it would be monstrous.”

But it is not so.

“Good is always strong.
Evil is always weak.
Virtue is never unrewarded.
Vice is never without its wage.”

And she leaned toward me.

“I will show you the way back to your home.
I will give wings to your mind.”

### **The Flight Above the Storm**

In her song,
my spirit rose.

It passed beyond the clouds,
beyond the fevered air,
beyond the wandering stars—

until it came to the stillness
where the King of all things
guides the world without moving.

“This,” she said,
“is where you belong.”

And suddenly the earth below
looked small.

### **What Power Really Is**

“Power,” she said,
“belongs only to the good.”

For will and power
are the roots of every action.

If someone desires something
but cannot achieve it,
they are weak.

If someone desires
and brings it to pass,
they are strong.

And what does every soul desire?

Happiness.
The good.

### **Who Reaches the Good**

“The good reach what they seek,” she said.
“The evil do not.”

For if the evil reached the good,
they would no longer be evil.

So it is not success that proves goodness—
it is arrival at the true good.

And those who fail to reach it,
no matter how loud their triumphs,
are weak.

---

### **The Quiet Measure of Strength**

Strength is not in noise.
Not in domination.
Not in the power to harm.

Strength is in reaching
what your deepest nature seeks.

And the deepest nature of every soul
seeks the good.

Only those who reach it
are truly powerful.

### **Two Ways of Walking**

She began to offer an image—

of two people
striving for the same goal:

one walking in harmony
with their nature,

the other mimicking the steps
but using what was never meant for walking.

I felt where she was leading me.

One moves forward.
The other stumbles.

And only one
is truly strong.

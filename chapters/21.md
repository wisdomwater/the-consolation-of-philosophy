## **Day 21 — Why the Good Are Strong and the Wicked Are Weak**

### **Two Ways of Walking**

Imagine two people trying to walk.

One uses their feet.
The other crawls on their hands.

Which one is truly capable?

The one using the power they were made for.

So it is with the soul.

Both the good and the wicked want the same thing:
happiness, the highest good.

But the good seek it through virtue —
through honesty, courage, patience, love.

The wicked seek it through greed, domination, and pleasure.

They want the same destination,
but they refuse the road that leads there.

### **Why Evil Is Not Strength**

The wicked labor endlessly.
They scheme.
They chase.
They grasp.

And yet they never reach what they want.

Not because happiness is hidden —
but because they abandon the very power that could reach it.

This is the deepest weakness:
to desire the good
but reject the way of goodness.

### **The Strange Truth About Existence**

Philosophy says something shocking:

Those who abandon goodness
begin to fall away from being itself.

Like a body that has lost its life,
they still move,
but they no longer truly live.

Evil is not another kind of existence.

It is a collapse of existence.

### **Why Doing Harm Is Not Power**

The highest good can do all things —
except evil.

So if someone can only harm,
they can do less than what is truly powerful.

The ability to destroy
is not strength.

It is lack of strength.

### **The Chains of the Powerful**

Look at tyrants on their thrones.

They wear crowns,
but inside they are bound by:

fear
rage
desire
envy
ambition

They command others,
but cannot command themselves.

They appear powerful.
They are not.

### **The Secret of Justice**

Every action carries its own reward.

The reward of goodness
is becoming whole.

The reward of evil
is becoming less.

No one can steal the crown of the good,
because it is not given from outside.

It is the peace of being what one truly is.

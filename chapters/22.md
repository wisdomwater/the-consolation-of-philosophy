## Day 22 — The Strange Strength of Goodness

### **Walking the Way We Were Made For**

“You would not deny,” she said,
“that walking belongs to the feet.”

“No.”

“And that a person who walks on their feet
is more capable than one who crawls on their hands?”

“Of course.”

“So it is with the soul,” she said.
“The good walk toward the good
by the feet of virtue.
The wicked try to reach the same place
by grasping and clutching—
by greed and desire.”

One moves as they were made to move.
The other strains against their own nature.

Only one arrives.

### **Why the Wicked Are Weak**

“They want the highest thing,” she said,
“and they fail to reach it.”

They labor day and night,
yet never touch
what they are seeking.

This is not a small failure.
It is the failure of everything.

To miss the highest good
is to miss oneself.

---

### **When a Person Loses Their Being**

“They lose not only power,” she said,
“but their very being.”

To fall away from the good
is to fall away
from what makes you a self.

As a corpse is not truly a person,
so one who has abandoned their nature
is no longer what they were meant to be.

They are still there—
but not whole.

---

### **The Illusion of Doing Evil**

“They can do evil,” I said.

“Yes,” she replied,
“but that is not power.
It is weakness.”

For evil itself is nothing.

To be able to do nothing
is not strength.

The highest good can do only good—
and that is why it is all-powerful.

### **The Tyrant Who Is Not Free**

She painted a picture for me—

Kings in purple,
surrounded by weapons,
faces fierce—

yet inside,
their hearts are chained.

Greed whips one.
Rage lashes another.
Fear stalks a third.

So many masters
inside a single ruler.

And none of them kind.

---

### **The Only True Reward**

“Every act,” she said,
“has its reward.”

The runner’s reward
is the crown.

The soul’s reward
is the good it seeks.

And since the good
is happiness,

no good life
can be without its crown.

It shines from within.

---

### **The Crown That Cannot Be Stolen**

“No one,” she said,
“can take it from you.”

External honors
can be stripped away.

But the glory of being good
is part of who you are.

Let the wicked rage.

The wise remain crowned.

## **Day 10 — When Even Fame Lets Go**

### **The Smallness of Glory**

“Do you know how small the world is?” she asked.

So small that even the greatest empires
fill only a speck of it.

So small that most of its people
will never hear your name.

So small that even the memory of cities
fades.

And yet you want to place your heart
in something as thin and fleeting
as reputation.

How long will anyone remember?
A century?
A thousand years?

Even that is nothing
next to eternity.

What does it matter
to be spoken of
in a moment that vanishes?

### **The Song of the Second Death**

Even the famous disappear.

Their names survive
only as faint scratches
on stone.

And when memory fades,
it is as though they died again.

Why trade your soul
for such a ghost?

### **The Strange Gift of Loss**

Then she said something
that startled me.

“Hard fortune helps more than easy fortune.”

“Good fortune lies.
It makes you think you are safe.”

“Bad fortune tells the truth.
It shows you what cannot be trusted.”

One binds you with comfort.
The other frees you with clarity.

### **The Friends Who Remain**

“When everything was taken from you,” she said,
something precious was revealed.

The people who stayed.

The ones who did not leave.

Those are your true riches.

Not what was lost —
but who was found.

### **The Song of Love**

All things are held together
by a single power:

Love.

It keeps the stars in their paths.
It binds the sea to its shores.
It holds people together
in faithfulness.

When Love holds the world,
it does not fall apart.

And when Love holds you,
you do not either.

### **A Quiet Closing**

You are not held
by fortune.

You are held
by something deeper.

By what binds
everything that is.

And that
is enough.

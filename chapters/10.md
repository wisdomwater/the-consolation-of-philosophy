## Day 10 — The Smallness of What the World Applauds

### **The False Nature of Power**

“If honour or power were truly good,” she said,
“they could not cling to the worst of people.”

“Nature does not bind opposites together.”

“And yet,” she went on,
“how often do we see the cruel enthroned,
the unjust exalted?”

“That alone tells you what these things are.”

“Gold does not make one generous.
Power does not make one free.
Honour does not make one honourable.”

“They reveal what already lives within.”

### **The Mask Torn Away**

“Riches do not cure greed,” she said.
“They inflame it.”

“Power does not break the chains of desire —
it tightens them.”

“Honours placed on the corrupt
only make their corruption visible.”

“These things wear names that do not belong to them.”

“And reality,” she said gently,
“refuses to lie.”

### **The Tyrant’s Throne**

She spoke of Nero —
a ruler of the whole world,
yet a slave to his own madness.

“He commanded nations,” she said,
“yet could not command himself.”

“What kind of power
gives a sword to cruelty?”

---

### **The Subtle Lure of Fame**

“I never loved vanity,” I said,
“but I wished my work to matter.”

“Yes,” she replied,
“even noble hearts
can be tempted by applause.”

“But look,” she said,
“at the world you want to fill with your name.”

“The earth is a point
within a vast heaven.
And only a fraction of that point
is even inhabited.”

“Is this where you wish
to carve immortality?”

---

### **The Narrow Reach of Renown**

“Most people,” she said,
“will never hear your name.”

“Languages divide us.
Oceans divide us.
Customs divide us.”

“And even the greatest cities
fade from memory.”

“How many heroes,” she asked,
“have vanished simply
because no one wrote them down?”

“And even what is written
is swallowed by time.”

---

### **The Infinite Measure**

“Compare ten thousand years
to eternity,” she said.

“It is nothing.”

“To seek eternal worth
in human praise
is to chase shadows.”

“If the soul dies,
no fame remains.
If it lives,
it rises beyond all such noise.”

“In either case,” she whispered,
“glory here cannot satisfy.”

---

### **The Final Turning**

“The soul that runs after fame,” she said,
“mistakes the wind for a destination.”

“Look at the sky.
Look at the smallness of this world.”

“Let shame fall away,
and let your heart be free.”

Silence followed —
not empty,
but vast.

## Day 31 — From Height to Eternity

### The Power That Knows

“There is a force within the soul,” she said, “that does more than receive impressions. It distinguishes what it knows, gathers what it has divided, and tests the false against the true.”

“This power moves freely,” she continued—“now rising to what is above, now descending to what is below, then returning to itself.” It is not merely stamped by what touches the body. It judges. It orders. It understands.

“When light strikes the eyes or sound enters the ears,” she said, “the spirit is stirred—but it does not remain passive. It calls forth forms it already holds within itself and fits them to what comes from without.”

The mind does not borrow its power from the world. It brings its own.

### Lower and Higher Ways of Knowing

“Consider,” she said, “how bodies affect the senses from without. The body receives, and the mind responds.”

“But if the mind already surpasses bodily impressions,” she asked, “how much more does it surpass what is altogether free from bodies?”

“There are many kinds of knowing,” she said, “and they belong to different kinds of beings.”

“The senses know only what touches them. Imagination belongs to creatures that move and desire. Reason belongs to humanity alone. And true intelligence belongs to God.”

Each higher way of knowing includes the lower—yet the lower cannot rise to judge the higher.

### Trusting the Stronger Sight

She imagined an argument. “Suppose the senses and imagination accuse reason,” she said. “‘What you call universals are illusions. Only what we touch or picture is real.’”

“And reason replies,” she said, “‘I see what you see—but from above. You cannot reach universals because your sight is bound to bodies. It is better to trust the clearer, wider vision.’”

“If such a trial were held,” she asked, “would you not side with reason?”

I nodded.

“And yet,” she said gently, “this is what you do not do with God.”

### The Mistake We Make About God’s Knowing

“You imagine,” she said, “that God must know future things in the same way you do—by looking ahead along a line of time.”

“So when you see uncertainty in events,” she continued, “you assume God must see the same uncertainty.”

“But if you could rise,” she said, “even a little, into the way God knows, you would judge differently—just as reason judges differently from sense.”

“If human reason could share the vision of divine intelligence,” she said, “it would yield gladly, as sense yields to reason.”

### The Invitation to Rise

“Lift yourself, then,” she said softly, “if you can, to the height of that highest intelligence.”

“There, reason sees what it cannot see on its own: how things that appear uncertain in time are known with complete certainty from above.”

“This knowing is not opinion,” she said. “It is not guesswork. It is a single, direct vision—unbounded, undivided, complete.”

### A Song of Upright Souls

She sang of living creatures—some crawling low, some flying, some walking the fields.

“All move differently,” the song said, “yet most keep their faces bent toward the ground, and so their senses grow dull.”

“But the human form stands upright,” it sang, “with head lifted high. This posture is a lesson.”

“If you do not cling to earth by foolish weight,” the song urged, “let your soul rise as your body does—lest the body stand tall while the mind lies low.”

---

### Eternity, Not Time

“Now,” she said, “we must speak of eternity.”

“For all knowing,” she reminded me, “is shaped by the nature of the knower.”

“Everyone agrees that God is eternal,” she said. “But few consider what this means.”

“Eternity,” she said slowly, “is the complete and simultaneous possession of infinite life.”

### The Difference Between Time and Eternity

“All that lives in time,” she said, “moves from past to future. It cannot hold its whole life at once.”

“Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow is not yet. Today is a passing moment.”

“Even what has no beginning or end in time,” she said, “is not therefore eternal. For it does not possess its whole life at once.”

“What is truly eternal,” she said, “lacks nothing of the future and has lost nothing of the past. It is wholly present to itself.”

“And from that eternal present,” she said, “it holds all time at once.”

She fell silent.

And for the first time, I sensed that the answer was not ahead of me in time—but above me, waiting to be seen.

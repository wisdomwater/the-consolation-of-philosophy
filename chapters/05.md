## Day 5 — Remembering Who We Are

### **The Forgotten Self**

“How could I forget that I am a human being?” I said.

“And what is a human being?” she asked.

“A living creature,” I replied,
“capable of reason and destined to die.”

“And is that all?” she asked gently.

I paused.
“There is nothing more that I know.”

Something in her gaze softened — and sharpened at once.

### **The Root of the Illness**

“Now I see,” she said quietly.
“This is where your sickness begins.”

“You have forgotten who you are.”

“That is why exile feels like annihilation.
That is why loss feels like the end of being.”

“You have forgotten the purpose of all things,
so you think the wicked are powerful
and the good are crushed.”

“You have forgotten how the world is governed,
so you imagine that fortune stumbles blindly.”

“This forgetfulness,” she said,
“is not a small wound.
It is a sickness of the soul.”

### **The Spark That Remains**

“And yet,” she continued,
“all is not lost.”

“You still know this:
the universe is not ruled by chance,
but by divine reason.”

“This tiny spark is enough,” she smiled.
“From it, life can be rekindled.”

“Do not be afraid,” she said.
“We will not use harsh remedies yet.”

“First we must clear away
the fog of false opinions
that have gathered around you.”

### **The Gentle Clearing**

“Minds,” she said,
“are quick to put on illusions
and slow to let them go.”

“Fear, hope, pleasure, and grief
have wrapped you in shadows.”

“So we will soften them.
Slowly.”

“Then you will be able to see again.”

### **The Clouded Sky**

“When clouds cover the stars,” she said,
“their light is still there —
but you cannot see it.”

“When storms churn the sea,
what was once clear
becomes dark and troubled.”

“When a stream meets a fallen stone,
it stumbles and breaks its flow.”

“So it is with the mind.”

### **The Way Back to Light**

“If you would see clearly,” she said,
“walk the straight path.”

“Let go of passing joys.
Release your fears.
Lay down your false hopes.”

“And give no throne to grief.”

“For where these rule,
the soul is chained
and the light is hidden.”

Her words did not wound me.

They opened something —
as if a forgotten door
were quietly being unlatched.

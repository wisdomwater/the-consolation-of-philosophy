## **Day 5 — When You Forget Who You Are**

### **The Diagnosis**

“Do you know what you are?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said.
“A human being.
Mortal.
Capable of reason.”

She looked at me quietly.

“And is that all?”

I searched inside myself.
I found nothing more.

Then she said the words
that gently but firmly
touched the center of my pain:

“This is why you are suffering.
You have forgotten yourself.”

“You think you are ruined
because you think you are only
what has been taken from you.”

“You believe wicked people are powerful
because you have forgotten
what power truly is.”

“You think the world is chaotic
because you have forgotten
that it is held.”

“And yet,” she said softly,
“there is still a spark in you.
You still believe that all things
are guided by a deeper wisdom.”

“That is enough for healing to begin.”

### **The Gentle Promise**

“We will not use harsh remedies yet,” she said.
“You are still too wounded.”

“When people are in pain,
they wrap themselves in false stories.
These stories create shadows
that hide what is real.”

“So we will begin gently,
until the fog lifts
and the light can return.”

### **The Song of Clearing**

When clouds cover the sky,
the stars are still there,
even if we cannot see them.

When storms stir the sea,
the water turns dark,
though it was once clear.

When a river meets a fallen stone,
it stumbles
but does not cease to flow.

So it is with you.

If you want to see what is true,
let go of what pulls you off the path.

Let go of passing pleasures.
Let go of fear.
Let go of empty hopes.
Let go of grief.

Where these rule,
the soul cannot see.

### **The First Medicine**

After a quiet pause,
she began again.

“The reason you are in such pain
is not simply what happened to you.

It is how deeply you had trusted
what could be taken away.”

“Fortune did not betray you,” she said.
“She only revealed
what she always was.”

“You used to know this.
You even warned others about it.”

“But no sudden change comes
without shaking the heart.”

“So now,” she said gently,
“we will begin with small,
kind medicines —
soft words that prepare the way
for deeper healing.”

### **The Truth About Fortune**

“Why are you grieving?” she asked.
“Because something unexpected happened?”

“Then you have learned
who Fortune really is.”

“She smiles to deceive.
She turns away without warning.”

“If you enjoy her gifts,
enjoy them lightly.”

“If she frightens you,
let her go.”

For no one can bind
what was never meant to stay.

### **A Quiet Turning**

What hurts us most
is not that things change.

It is that we believed
they would not.

Healing begins
when we loosen our grip
on what cannot hold us.

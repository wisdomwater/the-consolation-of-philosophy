## Day 1 — The Shattered Song

### **The Lament**

Once I sang easily, as though the world itself were a kind companion.
Now my words fall like tears, slow and heavy, each one carrying the weight of what has been lost.
“My Muses are maimed,” I whisper, “and they lead me only through sorrow.”

Time has not merely passed; it has struck.
Grief has come early, setting old age upon me before its hour.
My hair whitens not from years but from heartbreak, and even my skin seems to know the truth before I do.

“Happy is the one,” I murmur, “who meets death in joy.
But death turns away from those who weep.
It leaves the unhappy to linger in long nights that will not end.”

Fortune once smiled, and I trusted her.
Now her face has changed, and I am left to drag the remainder of my days behind me.
“Why did you ever call me blessed?” I ask the invisible friends of my former life.
“One who falls so far was never standing on firm ground.”

### **The Quiet Arrival**

As these words settled on the page, a presence gathered above me.
I felt it before I saw it — a weight of clarity, a nearness that was both gentle and commanding.

She stood there, luminous and severe, her eyes bright with a fire that seemed to see through every veil.
Her form was ancient and young at once, rising and falling like the breath of the cosmos itself.

Her robe bore strange signs, stitched between earth and heaven, worn by time yet still whole.
In one hand she held books. In the other, a sceptre — knowledge and authority joined.

I could not yet speak.
I could barely look.
Something in her gaze made my sorrow feel suddenly small — and terribly exposed.

### **The Silencing of the Sirens**

Around my bed lingered the soft-voiced Muses, still coaxing grief into song.
She turned to them with a flame in her eyes.

“Who has allowed these sweet deceivers near this wounded mind?” she said.
“They do not heal sorrow. They dress it in honey and let it grow.”

“They choke reason with emotion,” she continued,
“and teach the heart to love its own sickness.
Leave him. These are my fields, not yours.”

The Muses, ashamed, lowered their eyes and slipped away without a word.
Their beauty dimmed as they crossed the threshold, like music fading from a closed room.

I was left alone with her — and with myself.

### **The Forgotten Self**

She came closer and sat beside me.
Her eyes searched my face, heavy with grief and lowered to the dust.

“Ah,” she said softly, “how the mind dims when it sinks beneath the flood.
Its own light goes out, and it gropes for darkness instead.”

“You once walked beneath open skies.
You knew the dance of the stars and the seasons of the earth.
You asked where the winds were born and why the moon waxes and wanes.”

“You touched the deep order of things,” she said,
“and now you stare only at the ground.”

Her words were not cruel — but they were true.
And truth stung like cold air in a dark room.

### **The Physician’s Touch**

“This is no time for lament,” she said gently.
“This is a time for healing.”

She looked into me with a steadiness that would not look away.
“Do you know me? Have you forgotten who fed you when you were still growing into yourself?”

“You were armed,” she said,
“strong enough to stand against fortune —
but you laid your weapons down.”

I could not answer.
Not because I would not — but because I could not.

### **The Lifting of the Veil**

Seeing my silence, she placed her hand upon my chest.
“There is no danger,” she whispered.
“He is only asleep to himself.”

“He will remember,” she said,
“when he sees clearly again.”

She gathered her robe and wiped the tears from my eyes,
as though brushing away a veil that did not belong there.

And something shifted.

The darkness loosened its hold.
The world felt wider — as if dawn were quietly returning to a long-forgotten sky.

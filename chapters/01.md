## **Day 1 — When Everything You Knew Begins to Slip Away**

### **The Lament**

Once my days were full of music.
My work flowed easily.
There was light in what I did.

Now everything I write is soaked with tears.
Even the songs that once gave me joy
have become dark companions in my grief.

The things that used to stand beside me —
my confidence, my pride, my sense of belonging —
have quietly slipped away.
In their place I feel the weight of age,
though I am not yet old.
My body feels tired.
My spirit feels worn thin.

Strange how death ignores the happy
and lingers so stubbornly with the broken.
Strange how suffering stretches time
until even breathing feels slow and heavy.

Fortune once smiled on me.
Now her face has turned away.
And life, stripped of its brightness,
drags itself forward without desire.

Why did I ever believe I was secure?
Why did I let myself think I was fortunate?
The one who falls the furthest
is the one who once stood highest.

### **The Appearing**

As I sat with these thoughts, writing them down in silence,
something changed in the room.

A presence stood beside me.

Not small.
Not gentle in the way we imagine gentleness.
But vast —
older than time and brighter than fear.

Her eyes were alive with a fire that saw straight through me.
Her strength had not faded, even though she carried the weight of ages.
At times she seemed as tall as the sky,
and at other times close enough to sit at my side.

Her clothing was finely woven,
though torn in places,
as if many hands had tried to claim it
and take from it what they could.

In one hand she held books.
In the other, a staff.

And when she saw the voices of self-pity and despair
gathered around me,
she spoke sharply:

“Who allowed these performers of sorrow to come here?
They don’t heal.
They only sweeten the pain and make it grow.

They do not free the mind.
They train it to stay sick.

Leave him now.
He belongs to me.”

Ashamed, those voices withdrew.

I could barely lift my eyes.
Tears had blurred everything.
I did not yet know who she was —
only that she carried authority I could not resist.

She came closer and sat beside me.
She looked at my grief without flinching.

Then she spoke, not in anger,
but in a voice that held both sorrow and strength.

### **The First Song of Wisdom**

How dim the mind becomes
when it is flooded with sorrow.
Its own light goes out,
and it stumbles toward darkness.

This one once walked freely beneath the sky.
They studied the stars.
They wondered at the moon.
They sought the hidden patterns of the world.

They listened to the rhythms of nature
and the quiet laws that shape all things.

But now they lie here,
chained by grief,
their eyes fixed only on the ground.

They have forgotten the sky.

### **The First Touch**

She leaned toward me
and gently brushed the tears from my eyes.

And for the first time since everything fell apart,
I began — just barely —
to see again.

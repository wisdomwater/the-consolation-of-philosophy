## Day 25 — Beneath the Turning of the Stars

### The Cry of Injustice

“I see it,” I said, “how joy and sorrow cling to the deserts of the good and the bad. Yet still I cannot quiet my heart.”
For even the wise would not choose exile and disgrace over a life of honor and flourishing. There is a goodness in just order, when virtue bears fruit and wrongdoing is restrained.

“And yet look around,” I whispered. “The prisons are filled with the innocent, while the violent walk free. The rewards of virtue are seized by the unworthy, and the cost of sin is paid by those who tried to live well.”

It was not bitterness that spoke, but bewilderment. “If God governs all,” I said, “how can such crossings of fate be allowed? Why does sorrow fall on the gentle, and abundance on the cruel?”

My words were a kind of prayer, not for answers alone, but for a world that made sense.

### The Hidden Order

“It is no wonder,” she said softly, “that what you do not yet see appears as chaos.”
“The mind stumbles when it looks upon a pattern whose threads it cannot trace.”

“Do not imagine,” she went on, “that because the design is hidden, it is absent. The universe is not ruled by accident, but by a wise and gentle Governor.”

“You are like one who, seeing only a single stitch, doubts the beauty of the whole cloth.”
“Trust this much, even now: nothing is without its place.”

### The Confusion of Appearances

She lifted her gaze as if toward the sky.
“Who would not be baffled,” she asked, “if they did not know why the stars move as they do?”

“When Arcturus circles the pole, and Boötes lingers in his slow arc, the ignorant call it strange.”
“When the moon dims and the people clang their cymbals to ward off imagined disaster, it is not the heavens that err, but human understanding.”

“Storms and thawing snow do not frighten us,” she said, “because their causes are near and visible. But when the reasons lie far beyond our sight, we call the world unjust.”

“Let ignorance fall away,” she whispered, “and what once seemed cruel will be revealed as ordered.”

### The Question That Opens All Others

“Then tell me,” I pleaded, “unravel this knot.”
“For this mystery—why good and evil receive such tangled fates—will not let me rest.”

She smiled, not with mockery, but with awe.
“This question,” she said, “touches the deepest roots of all things. Cut one thread, and a hundred more appear.”

“Here live Providence and Fate, freedom and foreknowledge, chance and divine will.”
“To walk here is to walk near the fire at the heart of the world.”

“Still,” she said, “since your healing requires it, I will lead you a little way into this holy maze.”

### Providence, the Quiet Mind of God

“All that comes to be,” she began, “rises from the unchanging mind of God.”
“Every movement, every form, every season draws its order from that stillness.”

“When this ordering is seen within the divine simplicity, it is called Providence.”
“It is God’s own knowing of all that shall be.”

Providence is not a chain, but a vision—
the whole universe held at once in a single, luminous thought.

### Fate, the Unfolding in Time

“But when that same divine vision is carried into motion,” she said, “it is called Fate.”
“It is the way the eternal is worked out through moments and change.”

“Providence sees all at once,” she continued,
“Fate steps it out, one breath, one hour, one turning of the world at a time.”

As the artisan holds a design in the mind before shaping it with the hands,
so God holds all things in Providence,
and brings them forth through Fate.

### Near the Center, Near to Freedom

“All that moves in time is touched by Fate,” she said,
“but all that moves is still held by Providence.”

“Yet some things dwell so near the divine center that they are scarcely bound at all.”
“They turn not in wide wandering circles, but rest close to the still point.”

“As a wheel spins around its hub,” she whispered,
“so all creation turns around the unchanging Good.”
“The closer to that center, the freer the soul becomes.”

“To cling to the divine intellect,” she said,
“is to rise above the restless turning of Fate and enter into the quiet of God.”

## Day 12 — The Shape of True Happiness

### **The Readiness to Go Deeper**

When her song faded, a stillness filled me.
“I am ready now,” I said.
“Not only to be comforted,
but to be healed.”

She smiled.
“What comes next will taste bitter,” she warned,
“but it will sweeten your soul.”

“Where will you lead me?” I asked.

“To the happiness your heart already longs for,” she said.
“You see it dimly,
but you have been staring at its shadow.”

### **Clearing the Field**

“Before the seed can grow,” she said,
“the thorns must be cut away.”

“After bitterness, honey is sweeter.
After storm, the stars shine clearer.”

“You have looked long enough
at false happiness.”

“Now lift your neck
from under her yoke.”

### **The One Desire Beneath All Others**

“All people seek one thing,” she said,
“though they chase it by many roads.”

“That one thing is happiness.”

“It is the state in which nothing is lacking,
where all good is gathered into one.”

“If any good were missing,
it would not be complete.”

“This desire is planted in every heart,” she said.
“Error only makes us lose our way.”

### **The Many Masks of the Same Longing**

“Some seek riches,
believing they will be secure.”

“Some seek honour,
believing it will give them worth.”

“Some seek power,
believing it will make them strong.”

“Some seek fame,
believing it will make them known.”

“Some seek pleasure,
believing it will make them glad.”

“But all,” she said softly,
“are seeking happiness.”

### **The Drunken Wanderer**

“We are like one who knows
they are going home,
but cannot remember the road.”

“No one is wrong
to want sufficiency,
dignity,
strength,
honour,
and joy.”

“These are all fragments
of what we truly want.”

### **The One Hidden Good**

“They are rays,” she said,
“from one sun.”

“When we mistake the rays for the sun,
we wander.”

“Nature has written the truth in us —
we only forget how to read it.”

And in that moment,
I felt the first quiet certainty
that something whole
was waiting to be found.

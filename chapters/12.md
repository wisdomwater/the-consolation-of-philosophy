## **Day 12 — When the Soul Remembers Its Way Home**

### **The Song of Return**

Everything longs to go back
to where it belongs.

A wild creature, even when fed,
remembers its freedom.
Once it tastes blood again,
it knows who it truly is.

A bird, though gently cared for,
still sings for the forest.
Honey cannot replace the trees.

A bent branch, once released,
lifts itself toward the sky.

The sun sets —
and rises again.

Nothing rests until it finds
its true course.

Neither do you.

### **The Forgotten Memory**

“You too,” she said,
“carry a memory inside you.”

You may not see it clearly,
but your heart remembers
what wholeness feels like.

Even when you chase false goods,
you are still trying
to find your way home.

Your mistakes
are misdirected longing.

### **The Test of Wealth**

“Let us be honest,” she said.

“When you were rich,
was your mind ever free from worry?”

“No.”

“Because something was missing,
or because something was wrong?”

“Yes.”

“Then even with wealth,
you still lacked.”

“Yes.”

“And while a person lacks anything,
can they be at peace?”

“No.”

“Then wealth,” she said gently,
“did not do what it promised.”

### **The Hidden Cost of Riches**

Money cannot protect itself.
It must be guarded.

To have it
is to need others.

To keep it
is to worry.

Nature needs little.
Greed has no end.

The more you have,
the more you must defend.

### **The Song of Empty Treasure**

Even the richest
carry anxiety.

And when they die,
their wealth stays behind.

It was never theirs.

### **The Illusion of Honor**

“But surely honor makes a person honorable,” I said.

“Does it?” she replied.

High places do not create virtue.
They only expose what is already there.

When a corrupt person is lifted high,
their corruption becomes more visible.

But when a wise person stands before you,
you honor them —
not because of their title,
but because of who they are.

Honor flows from virtue,
not the other way around.

### **A Quiet Truth**

You cannot become worthy
by standing on a pedestal.

You become worthy
by becoming yourself.

And nothing outside you
can do that for you.

## Day 16 — The One Good and the Way Home

### **The Thing That Cannot Be Broken**

“It cannot admit unhappiness,” I said slowly,
“if it truly holds all satisfaction, power, honor, and joy.”

“Yes,” she replied.
“Though we name these things differently,
they are not different in being.”

They are one light
seen through many windows.

“One simple thing,” she said,
“made into fragments by human error.”

We try to grasp pieces of what has no parts.
And so we lose both the pieces we chase
and the wholeness we never sought.

### **How We Miss What We Want**

“One pursues riches,” she said,
“and gives up dignity, power, joy, even rest—
so that the wealth he wins
cannot satisfy him.”

Another pursues power
and throws away peace, pleasure, and honor,
until fear eats the strength he tried to claim.

Another chases glory.
Another, delight.

But because each of these
is secretly the same thing,
to seek one alone
is to lose them all.

### **The Circle That Will Not Be Cut**

“Tell me,” she asked,
“if someone sought them all together,
would they find them in these things?”

“No.”

“Then happiness does not dwell
where we have been looking.”

The truth felt clear now,
like a bell struck in still air.

What we chased were reflections,
not the light.

### **The One That Gives All**

I said quietly,
“True happiness must be the thing
that truly makes a person whole—
satisfied, strong, honored, radiant, alive.”

“And what gives any one of these,” I added,
“must give them all,
for they are one.”

She looked at me tenderly.
“You have seen deeply,” she said.

“But tell me—
does anything in this mortal world
have power to give such a gift?”

“No,” I answered.
“Only shadows of it.”

### **The Turning of the Heart**

“These things we have named,” she said,
“can show a glimmer of the good,
but not the good itself.”

And now, she said,
we must turn
toward where the true good lives.

“Then let us ask for help,” I said.
“For nothing begins rightly
unless we call upon the Father of all.”

She smiled.
“And so we shall.”

### **The Prayer of Return**

She lifted her voice.

“O Thou who rulest all things
with unchanging law,
who standest firm in Eternity
and yet givest motion to all…

From within Thyself
Thou didst conceive the pattern of all good.
Without envy, without lack,
Thou didst pour beauty into being.

Thou hast balanced all things—
fire and earth,
heat and cold,
light and weight—
so that none overwhelms the other.

Thou hast placed the soul
between matter and mind,
a living bridge,
moving the world
and returning always toward Thee.”

And as she spoke,
I felt the universe breathing.

---

### **The Light We Seek**

“Grant,” she prayed,
“that our minds may rise to Thy throne.
Grant that we may see Thee without blindness.”

“Scatter the clouds of this heavy world.
Shine in Thy own true glory.”

“You are our rest.
Our beginning.
Our path.
Our end.”

And I felt, in the silence that followed,
a longing older than my sorrow.

---

### **Where the Good Must Be**

“Since you have seen,” she said,
“both the false and the true form of happiness,
we must now ask where the true can live.”

“For if something is called imperfect,” she said,
“there must exist somewhere
that which is perfect.”

The shadow proves the sun.
The wound proves the whole.

“And so,” she whispered,
“the highest good
is not a dream.

It has a home.”

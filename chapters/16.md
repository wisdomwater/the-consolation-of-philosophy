## **Day 16 — When God and Happiness Are Seen to Be the Same**

### **The Source of All Good**

“If there is imperfect happiness,” she said,
“there must be perfect happiness.”

Every shadow implies a light.

Every fragment
implies a whole.

And the one thing
that all minds agree on
is this:

God is the source of all that is good.

Nothing can be better than God —
so nothing can contain more goodness.

Therefore,
the highest good
must live in God.

### **The Gentle Shock**

“But be careful,” she said.

Do not think of God
as *having* goodness.

God *is* goodness.

If goodness came to God from elsewhere,
that elsewhere would be greater.

If goodness were something separate from God,
then God would not be the highest.

But God and the Good
are one.

### **The Identity of Happiness**

“Now remember,” she continued,
“we agreed that happiness is the highest good.”

And if God is the highest good,
then happiness and God
are not two things.

They are the same.

To be truly happy
is to be aligned
with God.

### **The Beautiful Consequence**

“Then here is something even more radiant,” she said.

People become just
by sharing in justice.

People become wise
by sharing in wisdom.

So people become happy
by sharing in God.

This does not make them God by nature —
but it makes them divine by participation.

To live in happiness
is to live in God.

### **The Center of All Desires**

“All the things people chase,” she said —
satisfaction, power, honor, fame, pleasure —
they are not parts of happiness.

They are *aiming at* happiness.

They are like arrows
flying toward a single target.

What they really want
is the Good.

### **The Quiet Truth**

Everything you have ever wanted
was a distorted longing
for God.

Not the idea of God.
Not the rules about God.

But the living Good
that holds everything together.

And now,
at last,
you are being shown
what you were seeking
all along.

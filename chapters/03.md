## Day 3 — The Wound of Injustice

### **The Bitter Accounting**

“I had no shelter left,” I said quietly.
“Those I helped were safer than I was,
for I kept no favors among the powerful.”

“My accusers were men already condemned,
desperate enough to trade truth for survival.
And their lies were welcomed.”

“Does Fortune feel no shame?” I asked.
“If not for me, then at least for the filth of those she lifted to strike me?”

### **The Crime of Loving What Is Good**

“They said I desired the safety of the Senate,” I went on.
“Yes — I did. And I still do.”

“Is it a crime to wish a people well?”
“Is it treason to guard the body of our common life?”

“I will not deny it,” I said.
“I will not pretend falsehood to satisfy a verdict.”

“Let history know the truth, even if the court would not hear it.”

### **The Silence of the Just**

“They forged letters.
They barred me from questioning my accusers.”

“No voice was allowed for the one who was judged.”

“If I had known of a plot,” I said bitterly,
“it would never have lived long enough to be spoken.”

“What wounds me most,” I confessed,
“is not that evil men attack the good —
but that they expect to succeed.”

“‘If God is, why is there evil?’
‘If God is not, why is there good?’”

These questions burned in me like unhealed fire.

### **The Lonely Courage of Integrity**

“I stood for the Senate at Verona,” I said.
“You were there — you know it.”

“I risked myself to defend what was just.
Not for praise.
Not for display.”

“For a clean conscience loses something
every time it is paraded for reward.”

“And yet this is the harvest:
punishment for innocence,
exile for fidelity.”

### **Condemned Without a Voice**

“I was not allowed to stand before my judges.
I was sentenced from far away,
as though I were already a ghost.”

“If I had committed murder,
if I had burned temples or slaughtered priests,
I would at least have been heard.”

“But for loving the Senate too much,
I was condemned without a hearing.”

“I was stripped of all things —
even my right to speak.”

### **The False Shape of Guilt**

“They had to lie to make their story fit.
They claimed I had corrupted myself for office.”

“But you lived within me,” I said softly.
“Where your light was,
no hunger for corrupt gain could live.”

“You taught me to follow God, not men.
How could I then bow to the basest wills?”

“My home, my friends, my family —
all testified to my innocence.”

“And yet,” I whispered,
“they turned even you into an accomplice,
as though loving wisdom were itself a crime.”

---

### **The Weight of the World’s Judgment**

“Worse still,” I said,
“the world believes what fortune favors.”

“When a person falls,
people assume they must have deserved it.”

“So kindness becomes guilt.
And suffering becomes proof.”

“I am robbed of peace,
of honor,
of even the right to defend myself.”

“And everywhere I see the wicked emboldened,
and the innocent silenced by fear.”

### **The Cry Toward Heaven**

My words gave way to prayer.

“O Architect of the stars,” I whispered,
“You who bind the heavens with law,
who guide the moon and command the skies—”

“Do you see this world?”

“Do you see how justice stumbles,
and lies walk proudly?”

My voice faltered,
but the cry had already risen.

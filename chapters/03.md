## **Day 3 — When Innocence Is Not Enough**

### **The Accusation**

I thought I would be safer
among the people I had helped.
I was wrong.

Those who testified against me
were not seekers of truth.
They were desperate men —
already disgraced, already condemned —
using my name to buy their own escape.

They said I was guilty
because they needed someone to be.

They said I had committed a crime
because they had already decided
I must be punished.

And what was my crime?

That I wanted the Senate to be safe.
That I tried to protect the common good.
That I refused to let lies be used
to destroy what was still honest.

If that is guilt,
then I will never deny it.

I wanted justice to survive.
I wanted goodness to matter.

### **The Injustice**

I was not allowed to face my accusers.
I was not allowed to speak.
I was judged from far away,
as if my life were a rumor,
not a human being.

If I had been accused of violence,
of sacrilege,
of hatred,
I would have been present to answer.

But I was condemned
simply for loving what was right.

And so I sit here,
nearly five hundred miles from my home,
sentenced to death and disgrace,
because I would not betray
what my conscience knew to be true.

### **The Wound of Betrayal**

What hurts most
is not that wicked people hated me.

It is that even the good
fell silent.

Reputation fades
when fortune turns.
Those who once praised you
step back
to save themselves.

I see it now:
the criminals celebrate,
the fearful stay quiet,
and the innocent are left
with no voice at all.

This is what a broken world does
to those who try to be whole.

### **The Integrity That Remains**

And yet,
even now,
I know this:

I did not live for power.
I did not serve greed.
I did not sell my soul
for advantage.

You taught me to follow
what is eternal,
not what passes.

You taught me
to seek what is true,
even when it costs everything.

So if this is what faithfulness earns,
then let it be written plainly:

I lost my freedom.
I lost my name.
I lost my future.

But I did not lose myself.

### **The Cry Toward Heaven**

O Maker of the stars,
who holds the heavens in their order,
who turns the sky with quiet precision
and gives light to moon and sun alike—

Do you see this?

Do you see how innocence is crushed,
how truth is twisted,
how justice is traded for fear?

I am still here.
I am still breathing.
I am still asking.

Where does goodness go
when the world forgets it?

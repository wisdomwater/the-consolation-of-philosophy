## Day 28 — The Hidden Order of Things

### The Question of Chance

She had finished speaking and was already turning inward toward other matters when a restlessness rose again within me. “What you say of Providence rings true,” I said, “but it pulls at other questions. Tell me—does chance exist at all? And if it does, what is it?”

She paused, as if weighing not the question but my strength. “I am eager to show you the path home,” she said gently, “but some questions lie off the road. Wander too long, and you may grow weary before the straight way is done.”

“Do not fear that,” I replied. “To know these things gives me rest. When your reasoning stands firm, what follows will not shake me.”

She consented, and her voice grew steady and clear.

### Nothing from Nothing

“If chance means events arising without cause,” she said, “then there is no such thing. It is only a word—empty, pointing nowhere.”

For where could randomness dwell, she asked, if all things are held within an ordered care? Nothing comes from nothing. If an event truly had no cause, it would spring from emptiness—and this is impossible.

“So chance, as people imagine it,” she said, “cannot exist in that sense at all.”

Yet the word lingers on human lips. And I asked again, “Is there then nothing that may rightly be called ‘by chance’? Or is it only that we misunderstand what we name?”

### The Meeting of Unintended Paths

She smiled slightly. “There is a truer meaning,” she said, “and one taught long ago.”

“When someone acts with one intention, and another outcome appears—one they neither planned nor foresaw—this is what people call chance.” She spoke of a man who digs the soil to cultivate his field and finds buried gold.

“Neither the one who hid it nor the one who dug intended the discovery,” she said. “Yet the gold appears.”

“Nothing here came from nothing.” The digging had its cause. The burying had its cause. Their meeting was unplanned, but not uncaused.

“Chance, then, is not disorder,” she said softly. “It is the unexpected meeting of ordered paths.”

### The Order Beneath the Accident

“The universe moves by a deep sequence,” she continued, “and within that movement, causes sometimes cross.” What feels accidental to us is simply unseen coordination.

She spoke of rivers rising from a single source, then splitting apart, only to meet again downstream. “When they reunite, their waters mingle—boats collide with boats, branches with branches—and this seems like chance.”

“Yet the riverbeds guide them. Gravity draws them. The slopes restrain their wandering.”

“So too with events,” she said. “What appears unruly still bears the bit. What seems ungoverned still follows a rule.”

### The Weight of the Question

I listened, and something settled. Yet another concern stirred. “If everything moves within such a chain of causes,” I asked, “what room is left for freedom? Are our own judgments bound as tightly as the stars?”

“There is free will,” she answered without hesitation. “Without it, reason itself could not exist.”

“For any being capable of reason must also be capable of judgment—of choosing what to seek and what to avoid. To desire and to refuse belong to reason’s very nature.”

### Degrees of Freedom

Yet freedom is not the same in all. “Divine minds,” she said, “see clearly, will steadily, and act without resistance.”

“Human spirits are freer when they rest in contemplation of God. They are less free when weighed down by the body. And least free of all when surrendered to vice.”

“When the mind turns from the light above toward lower darkness, vision dims. Ignorance clouds perception. Passions stir and bind.” She paused. “By yielding to them, the soul tightens its own chains.”

“This is the deepest slavery,” she said—not imposed from without, but chosen within.

### Seen and Seeing

Still, God sees all. From the height of eternity, nothing escapes the divine gaze. What has been, what is, what will be—each stands open before that single glance.

“The sun lights the surface of the world,” she said, “yet cannot pierce earth or sea. But the Creator sees through all things at once.”

“No darkness resists this vision. No depth conceals itself.”

“He alone sees all truly,” she said. “And so He alone may rightly be called the Sun.”

### The Unfinished Knot

As her words faded, I felt the weight return—not from disbelief, but from the tension they revealed. “Once more,” I said quietly, “I am plunged into doubt.”

She looked at me with calm recognition. “I know the shape of your trouble already,” she said. “Speak it.”

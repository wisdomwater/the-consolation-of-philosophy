## Day 18 — The Light That Makes All Things One

### **The One Desire Beneath All Desires**

“All things,” she said,
“are sought for the sake of the good.”

And since the good
and happiness
are one,

whatever we reach for—
wealth, honor, power, rest—
we are really reaching
for happiness.

And since happiness
and God
are one,

we are always, even when confused,
reaching for God.

### **The True Light**

“Come,” she called,
“you who are bound by passions.”

Not toward gold,
nor toward jewels,
nor toward the glitter that blinds the eyes—

but toward the light
that gives sight.

“All that shines in the world,” she said,
“is born in darkness.
But the light that moves the heavens
has no part in the shadows that ruin the soul.”

Whoever has seen this light
will find the sun itself
dim by comparison.

### **The Price of Knowing the Good**

“If you could know the absolute good,” she asked,
“what would you give?”

“Everything,” I said.
“For to know the good
is to know God.”

And she smiled,
for this was what
she meant to show me.

### **The Many That Must Become One**

“None of the things people chase,” she said,
“are good when they are divided.”

Satisfaction without peace.
Power without honor.
Fame without truth.
Pleasure without rest.

Each lacking the others,
each incomplete.

“But when they are gathered into one,” she said,
“they become what they pretended to be.”

Only unity
makes goodness whole.

---

### **The Secret of Goodness**

“Everything is good,” she said,
“only because it shares in the good.”

And if good and unity
do the same work,
they are the same thing.

Where there is unity,
there is goodness.

Where there is division,
goodness fades.

### **Why Things Live**

“Nothing lasts,” she said,
“unless it remains one.”

A body falls apart—
it is no longer a body.
A creature is divided—
it is no longer a creature.

To be
is to be one.

To lose unity
is to perish.

---

### **The Deep Instinct of Life**

“Is there anything,” she asked,
“that naturally longs to die?”

Every creature flees destruction.
Every life strains toward continuance.

Even without knowing it,
everything loves its own being.

This love is older than thought.
Deeper than choice.

---

### **The Silent Work of Nature**

Trees seek the soil that keeps them alive.
Roots drink.
Bark protects.
Seeds renew.

Fire rises.
Stone sinks.
Water reunites when cut.

Each thing,
in its own way,
is holding itself together.

---

### **The Will and the Root**

“Even in us,” she said,
“this love of being
is not born of decision.”

We breathe without choosing.
We digest without knowing.

The will may wander.
But nature remembers.

And underneath all our confusion
there is a quiet force
that says,

*Live.*

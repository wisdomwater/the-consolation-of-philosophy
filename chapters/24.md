## Day 24 — The Justice That Heals

### **The Strange Math of Suffering**

“We have agreed,” she said,
“that the good are happy
and the wicked are miserable.”

So if a wicked person is punished,
something good is added—
justice.

But if a wicked person goes free,
something evil is added—
injustice.

And so the one who is punished
is less miserable
than the one who is not.

Justice is not cruelty.
It is medicine.

### **Why Impunity Is Worse**

“To escape justice,” she said,
“is not a gift.”

It is a deeper wound.

To be left in wrongdoing
is to be left sick.

Punishment, though bitter,
is a turning toward health.

And so the unpunished
are the most to be pitied.

### **The Blindness of the World**

“People cannot see this,” she said,
“because their eyes are used to darkness.”

Like birds of night,
they mistake shadow for sight.

They think passion is freedom.
They think lawlessness is joy.

But the eternal order
tells another story.

### **We Become What We Look Toward**

“If you look upward,” she said,
“you become bright.”

“If you look downward,
you become small.”

No judge is needed.
We place ourselves.

By what we love,
we decide who we are.

---

### **Who Is More Miserable?**

“Tell me,” she asked,
“who should be punished—
the one who did harm,
or the one who suffered it?”

“The one who did harm.”

“Then the doer of injustice
is more miserable.”

For wrongdoing
is a deeper wound
than being wronged.

---

### **The Crime Is the Disease**

“Vice,” she said,
“is sickness of the soul.”

As we pity the sick,
so we should pity the wicked.

They need healing,
not hatred.

Punishment is not revenge.
It is treatment.

---

### **When the Guilty Would Choose Justice**

“If they could see,” she said,
“they would choose to be judged.”

For in punishment
they would lose their vice
and regain their virtue.

No one who truly understood
would cling to their sickness.

---

### **The End of Hatred**

“Hatred has no place
among the wise.”

For who hates the healthy?
And who hates the sick?

The one needs no anger.
The other needs care.

And so the world’s cruelty
is born of blindness.

### **A Dark Mirror**

And she began to sing
of people who rush toward death,
toward violence,
toward their own ruin—

not because death is scarce,
but because the heart is disordered.

And I felt the weight of it:
how often we destroy
what we were made to heal.

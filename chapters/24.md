## Day 24 — The Strange Mercy of Justice

### The Measure of Misery

“Then we agree,” she said, “that the good are happy, and the wicked are miserable.”
“Yes,” I answered, though something in me still resisted the simplicity of it.

“Now tell me,” she went on gently, “if even a little good is added to a life of misery, does it not make that life less wretched?”
“I suppose it must,” I said, feeling the quiet logic press against my unease.

“And if a further evil is added to one who has no good at all,” she asked, “does not that deepen the misery?”
“Of course,” I replied.

“Then see this,” she said: “When the wicked are punished, something good is added to them — justice itself. But when they go free, another evil is added — the injustice of their impunity.”

### The Paradox of Punishment

“So those who escape judgment,” she said, “are more wretched than those who suffer it.”
“For it is just that wrongdoing should meet its due.”

“And all that is just is good,” she continued, “while all that is unjust is evil.”
I could not escape the force of it.

“So do not envy those who walk unpunished,” she said softly.
“They are bearing a heavier burden than you know.”

The silence after her words felt like a door closing on a long-held illusion.

### A Justice That Follows the Soul

“Is there no punishment beyond this life?” I asked.
“Is the soul not called to account when the body has fallen away?”

“There is,” she said, “and it is both bitter and merciful. Some pains wound, others cleanse. But that is not our concern today.”

“My purpose,” she continued, “is to show you this: the wicked never miss the fruit of their deeds. Their power is an emptiness, their triumph a delay of sorrow.”

“And the longer their injustice lasts,” she said, “the deeper their unhappiness grows.”

### Eyes Trained in Darkness

“But people would never believe this,” I said.
“They call the freedom to do as one pleases a kind of happiness.”

“Yes,” she replied, “because their eyes are used to darkness. Like night-birds blinded by the sun, they cannot bear the clarity of truth.”

“They look to their feelings, not to the order of things,” she said, “and so mistake indulgence for joy.”

“If only they could gaze into the light of eternal law,” she whispered, “they would see where true happiness lives.”

### How We Place Ourselves

“There is no judge needed,” she said, “for the soul judges itself.”
“When you love what is good, you rise toward the stars.”

“When you cling to what is base,” she continued, “you fall toward the mud.”
No hand pushes you — you choose the direction by what you cherish.

“It is like lifting your eyes to heaven and then lowering them to the dirt,” she said.
“The world has not changed — only your gaze.”

### The Greater Misery

“Tell me this,” she said. “Who is more wretched: the one who does wrong, or the one who suffers it?”
“The one who does it,” I answered, without hesitation.

“For they deserve punishment,” she said, “and deserving punishment is misery already.”
The truth of it was hard and clean.

“Then the injury wounds the doer more deeply than the victim,” she said.
“The crime hollows out the soul that commits it.”

### The Physician’s Mercy

“The courts of men pity the wounded,” she said, “but wisdom would pity the ones who strike.”
“For their minds are sick with a worse illness than any bodily pain.”

“Bring them,” she said, “not as enemies to be crushed, but as patients to be healed.”
“Let punishment be medicine, not revenge.”

“If they could see what they have lost,” she went on, “they would beg for the very pains that restore them.”

“And there would be no hatred left among the wise,” she said,
“for only the foolish hate the sick.”

### The Madness of Violence

“Why do people chase death with their own hands?” she sang.
“Why do they rush into wars and wounds as though seeking their end?”

“Beasts hunt you for survival,” she said,
“but humans draw swords from twisted hearts.”

“Not because death is far away,” she whispered,
“but because their souls have forgotten how to live.”

## **Day 19 — When Even Evil Has No Power**

### **The Gentle Strength That Holds All Things**

The Good does not rule by force.

It governs by attraction.

Everything moves toward what gives it life —
and that is why the universe turns
not by violence
but by love.

Even when things resist,
they are only confused about what they truly want.

### **A Strange and Daring Thought**

“Is God all-powerful?”
Yes.

“Then can God do evil?”
No.

“Then what is evil?”

If evil were a real power,
it would exist outside God’s power.

But nothing exists outside God’s power.

So evil is not a thing.

It is a failure of being.

A distortion of the good.
A falling away from unity.
A shadow where light should be.

It has no substance of its own.

### **Why This Is Not Wordplay**

You are not being tricked.

This is the deepest truth:
**the good is real — evil is only a wound in the real.**

Light exists.
Darkness is only where light is missing.

Health exists.
Disease is the absence of harmony.

Being exists.
Evil is the loss of being.

That is why evil destroys.
It has no power to create.

### **The Song of Orpheus**

Orpheus could charm beasts,
still rivers,
soften hell itself.

But when grief made him turn back,
he lost what love had won.

This is not about myth.

It is about the soul.

When we turn our gaze downward
toward fear, resentment, despair,
we lose what we were carrying upward.

Not because God takes it —
but because looking away breaks the union.

### **The Quiet Warning**

Do not stare into the darkness
while you are being led toward the light.

The good is not fragile.

But your gaze is.

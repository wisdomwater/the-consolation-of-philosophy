## Day 19 — The Good That All Things Seek

### **The Deep Will to Be**

“Providence,” she said,
“has planted in every creature
the desire to remain.”

Even before thought,
before choice,
there is a quiet instinct that says,

*Do not vanish.*

Everything that lives
leans away from nothingness
and toward being.

And in this simple leaning
is already a prayer.

---

### **The Pull Toward Unity**

“That which seeks to endure,” she said,
“seeks unity.”

For only what is one
can remain.

When unity breaks,
being breaks.

And so, whether they know it or not,
all things are reaching
for what holds them together.

---

### **The Name of What We Want**

“You have agreed,” she said,
“that unity and the good
are the same.”

“Yes.”

“Then all things desire the good.”

Not this or that small good—
but the absolute good
that gives being to all.

And I felt a great stillness in that truth:
every longing,
every motion,
every breath
is drawn by the same center.

---

### **The End of All Things**

“This,” she said,
“is the final aim of everything.”

The good is not a side path.
It is the destination.

Whatever wanders
is only on its way back.

Whatever struggles
is only trying to come home.

---

### **The Light Within**

“Turn inward,” she said,
“if you would not be deceived.”

Bend the wandering mind
back into a single circle.

The treasure you seek
is already hidden within you.

The body clouds it,
but never destroys it.

A spark of truth
waits in the heart
to be breathed into flame.

---

### **The Remembering**

“When you answer truly,” she said,
“you are not being taught—
you are remembering.”

The voice of truth
has always been in you.

Learning is only
a homecoming.

---

### **The One Who Holds the World**

“You once said,” she reminded me,
“that you did not know
what guides the universe.”

“I remember,” I said.

“And yet,” she smiled,
“you also said
it must be God.”

For nothing so varied
could remain one
unless One held it.

And nothing so restless
could keep its rhythm
unless One were still.

---

### **The Helm of Goodness**

“If God is happiness,” she said,
“and happiness is the good,
then God steers all things by goodness.”

This good is not force.
It is direction.

It is the rudder
by which the whole creation
finds its course.

---

### **The Will That Cannot Be Broken**

“All things,” she said,
“are drawn toward the good.”

They follow it
because it is their life.

To resist it
would be to resist themselves.

And nothing that is
can finally oppose
what gives it being.

So the universe moves,
not as a chain,
but as a willing turning
toward love.

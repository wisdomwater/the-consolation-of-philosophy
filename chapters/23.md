## Day 23 — The Crown and the Beast

### **The Reward No One Can Take**

“The good,” she said,
“carry their reward inside themselves.”

For goodness itself
is already the prize.

To be good
is to be near God.
And to be near God
is to be divine.

No time can wear that away.
No enemy can steal it.
No injustice can dim it.

This is the crown
that does not rust.

### **The Punishment That Is a Person**

“And wickedness,” she said,
“is its own punishment.”

Not something added later—
but something lived.

To be filled with evil
is already to suffer.

No prison is darker
than a soul that has become
its own enemy.

---

### **When a Person Falls Out of Being**

“All that exists is one,” she said,
“and all that is one is good.”

So when a person
falls away from the good,
they fall away
from being.

They keep the shape of a human,
but lose the heart of one.

They are still seen—
but no longer whole.

---

### **The Beasts We Become**

Greed makes a wolf.
Lawsuits make a hound.
Guile makes a fox.
Rage makes a lion.
Fear makes a deer.
Sloth makes an ass.
Lust makes a swine.

When we abandon goodness,
we do not become free.

We become smaller.

### **Circe’s Cups**

She told me of Circe,
whose potions changed men into beasts.

But the truer poison,
she said,
does not touch the body.

It changes the mind.

It is not herbs that undo us,
but habits.

### **The Strange Mercy of Justice**

“Evil people,” she said,
“are more miserable when they succeed
than when they fail.”

For when will and power join
in doing wrong,
three miseries are born:

to desire evil,
to be able to do it,
and to have done it.

Punishment at least
cuts one of these away.

---

### **The Shortness of Wickedness**

“They will not go on forever,” she said.

Death comes—
quiet, unannounced.

And with it,
the end of their crimes.

If wickedness makes one miserable,
then the longer it lasts,
the worse the misery.

So even death
is a kind of limit.

---

### **A Harder Truth**

“And there is more,” she said softly.

“The wicked are happier
when they are punished
than when they are not.”

Not because pain is good—
but because justice
is closer to health
than chaos.

And my heart trembled,
waiting to hear
how this could be so.

## Day 23 — When the Soul Forgets Itself

### The Reward That Is Not Taken

“Do you see,” she said, “that no good person can ever be without reward?”
“For goodness itself is what they possess, and nothing greater can be given.”

“Why does anyone seek a reward,” she asked, “except because it is thought to be good?”
“And who, then, could say that the one who holds goodness does not already hold the prize?”

“The reward of the good,” she whispered, “is to become what they love.”
“And since happiness is the highest good, the good are drawn into the very life of God.”

“No time can wear this away,” she said.
“No power can steal it. No malice can darken it.”

### Wickedness as Its Own Punishment

“As honesty is the reward of the honest,” she continued,
“so wickedness is the punishment of the wicked.”

“They do not merely suffer evil,” she said,
“they are soaked in it.”

“If punishment is an evil,” she asked,
“what greater punishment could there be than to be filled through and through with the worst of all evils?”

The words fell like a solemn bell inside my heart.

### Losing the Shape of Being

“All that exists is good,” she said,
“and the Good itself is One.”

“When a soul turns away from goodness,” she went on,
“it slips away from being itself.”

“The body still bears a human face,” she said,
“but the soul has forgotten how to be human.”

“For goodness lifts us beyond ourselves,” she whispered,
“but evil drags us beneath ourselves.”

### The Many Faces of Forgetting

“Look,” she said, “how vice reshapes the soul.”

“The greedy man becomes a wolf,
the litigious one a snarling hound.”

“The sly one slips like a fox,
the furious one roars like a lion.”

“The fearful trembles like a deer,
the dull lives like a burdened beast.”

“And the one sunk in lust,” she said quietly,
“is held fast by the mire of the swine.”

### Circe’s Cup

“Do you remember,” she asked,
“the sailors who drank the sorceress’s wine?”

“Their bodies changed,” she said,
“but their minds remained — trapped inside the shapes of beasts.”

“So weak were those herbs,” she continued,
“they could touch only the flesh.”

“But vice,” she whispered,
“is a stronger poison.”

“It wounds not the body,” she said,
“but strikes at the very heart of who we are.”

### The Triple Wound

“They think,” I said, “that the wicked have great power.”

“They have none,” she replied,
“and yet their misery is deeper than you know.”

“To desire evil is misery.
“To have the power to do it is misery.
“To carry it out is misery.”

“Three wounds,” she said,
“all bleeding at once.”

### The Swift Limit

“I wish,” I said, “that their power would be taken from them.”

“It will be,” she answered gently,
“sooner than they expect.”

“For life is short,” she said,
“and even the boldest plans are cut short by sudden ends.”

“If wickedness makes one miserable,” she whispered,
“then endless wickedness would mean endless misery — and such a thing cannot endure.”

### The Strange Mercy of Justice

“One more truth follows,” she said,
“hard though it may seem.”

“The wicked are happier when they are punished
than when they go free.”

“Not only because punishment may heal,” she said,
“nor because it warns others — but because justice itself is a kind of light.”

“And to be kept from that light,” she whispered,
“is the deepest darkness of all.”

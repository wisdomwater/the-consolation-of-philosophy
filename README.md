# The Consolation of Philosophy — A Contemplative Edition

This repository contains a contemplative, devotional rendering of *The Consolation of Philosophy* by Boethius, structured as **daily readings**.

Rather than a scholarly translation or commentary, this project presents the text as an **interior dialogue**—meant to be read slowly, inwardly, and reflectively. The goal is not explanation, but *companionship*.

## About This Project

*The Consolation of Philosophy* was written by Boethius in the early sixth century while imprisoned and awaiting execution. Stripped of power, reputation, and certainty, Boethius enters into a dialogue with Lady Philosophy, who guides him through grief, anger, and confusion toward a deeper vision of freedom, goodness, and meaning.

This edition reshapes that dialogue into **daily contemplative readings**, preserving Boethius’ argument and imagery while rendering the language in a warm, meditative style suitable for spiritual reading.

This project was born from a modern encounter with injustice, disillusionment, and systems that promise fairness but often fail to deliver it. In Boethius, I found a sympathetic companion—and a voice that still speaks clearly across time.

## Structure

The text is organized as:

* **Daily readings** (Day 1–Day 32)
* Each day includes:

  * An evocative theme
  * Multiple short sections
  * Interior dialogue written as overheard conversation
* The full text is framed by:

  * A **Preface** (context and invitation)
  * An **Epilogue** (integration and benediction)

This structure is intentional. It encourages slow reading, pauses, and return—rather than completion.

## How to Read

This is not a book to rush through.

You are encouraged to:

* Read **one day at a time**
* Sit with unanswered questions
* Re-read sections that linger
* Allow silence to do part of the work

The text is designed to be companionable, not conclusive.

## Faithfulness and Approach

* Faithful to Boethius’ meaning, metaphors, and arguments
* No modern psychologizing or therapeutic reframing
* No academic commentary or critical apparatus
* Ancient voice preserved, softened for devotional use

This is not a replacement for scholarly translations. It is an *invitation to listen*.

## A Final Word

This project exists for those who find themselves asking:

* What remains when what I trusted has been taken?
* Does goodness still matter when outcomes feel unjust?
* Is freedom real when circumstances do not change?

If those questions resonate, you are welcome here.
